19,sunlite plate moonboots advice needed,Rollerskating,"Hi! I saw on a Reddit thread that someone had swapped out their stock Moonboot plates for Sunlite plates and didn’t have to drill new holes as they just lined up, so I thought I’d give it a shot! This proved to be true for my pair too (size 8 boot, ordered the Sunlite plate that would best fit my boot), but the Sunlite plate sticks out just a little bit at the back of the heel. 

My q for you - is this a dealbreaker and should I not bother with this? Or is this fine? The plate seems great other than sticking out just a teeny bit at the back. I’m pretty new to staking and still figuring out a lot as I go, so newbie friendly advice appreciated!

46,indoor wheel help,Rollerskating,"Hey Everyone!

I've been skating for a few months, always outdoors, and just started going to a local rink to skate indoors. I have the Sure Grip Malibu skates with the Malibu wheels (i use the radar energy wheels outdoors), and am wondering if those wheels are okay for indoor skating. The rink I go to has a hard, solid black floor which I'm assuming is concrete. Last night when I went there where a ton of really good skaters and it seemed like their skates glided across the floor much easier than mine, so I'm wondering if I need to invest in some harder wheels or if the Malibu wheels are too grippy/soft? I'm trying to learn transitions and skating backwards too so just wondering if having better indoor wheels will make that easier for me too. I've been down the whole Wood vs. Concrete floor/Hard vs. Soft wheel/Grip vs. Slippery rabbit hole and don't really know if what I have is ideal for indoor skating. 

Any suggestions?

I was skating there (mind you, it’s a part of the bike path and for public use. It’s basically a fork in path.) and a man comes out to smoke. He watches me as I skate back and forth, enjoying my first day. A voice broke through the music from my AirPods as he says “Why are you skating here?” I sigh knowing what’s about to happen. I reply “Cause it’s nice and straight right here, and there’s ice on the bike trail.”  

“Can’t you go somewhere else, it’s creeping me out” 

My mind says “This bike path is for public use.” 

I’m guessing my dark skin, red John Lennon sunglasses and bucket hat were probably creepier than going back and forth on roller skates. 

I reassured him. “I’m not going to rob your house. I already have a house of my own.”

He repeats his request. “Go somewhere else, it’s creepy,”

I told him that I was sorry, and that I didn’t know it was a crime to exist. Then I left. I’m really disappointed that my first day skating was like this.

69,roller skating revolution swept world article national geographic,Rollerskating,"Hey r/Rollerskating Community! 

Did you know that the first attempt to put wheels on shoes took place in the 1700s? Did you know that the first patent of roller skates had three wheels attached in a line and was designed by French invento C.L. Petibled? Did you know that the first public roller rink opened in **1866 in the Atlantic House**, in Rhode Island? 

More and more history of the roller skates is documented by **Annalisa Palumbo**, she is a Content Editor for Nation Geographic Magazine in Barcelona, Spain. In her latest article: [""The roller-skating revolution swept the world in the 1800s""](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/world-history-magazine/article/roller-skating-revolution-swept-world-1800s), she explores a detail and informative brief history of the inventors of roller skating. She also describe several patents that were discover: ""the skeelers"", ""the Volito"", ""the rocker skate"", ""the rinkualists"", and more types. 

I recommend this article since, I think might benefit you in your knowledge about roller skates! Can you guess what would be the future of roller skates? Let me know what you think! 

And remember always use protective gear.

82,skate park gatekeeping common issue,Rollerskating,"I saw a video of a girl trying to quad skate at a busy skate park. She was admittedly being rude, hogging the bowl and not understanding the concept of turn-taking. I was shocked to find the comments were entirely filled with ""this is why rollerblades don't belong in skate parks"", ""skate parks are made for SKATEBOARDS"", and ""go to a rink if you're not on a skateboard!"" Rather than, oh I don't know, ""Hey! You should probably be taking turns and wearing a helmet especially with how crowded it was!""

It really threw me off guard and hurt a bit. I personally just like to glide and dance a bit, but I know many talented park skaters who attempt tricks I would pass out if I tried to do. The few times I've gone to my local park, the guys on skateboards were quite kind &amp; asked me questions about my skates and got to know me. (Given, I had better etiquette)

Do skateboarders get that mad where you live? Do you have to find a place where you can get along and skate freely without judgement? I didn't realize people were so cruel and didn't understand the legitimacy and skill of park skating.

And here we are. With my first choice skates and they’ve blown me away tonight. I came home from a long day of work in a mood, a customer literally took off his mask to tell me he has covid 😑 men will always have the audacity. Regardless I decided to throw on my skates despite my achy feet. 

I don’t know what kind of magic is weaved into Moxi skates but I literally advanced so much tonight! I practiced my toe stops, slaloms, spins, backwards skating and so much more with wayyy more smoothness &amp; grace than what I usually have. Things finally clicked and I’m convinced these skates are the reason why.

Mind you I haven’t skated in almost a month. I’m glad I took the time to make these skates my own, I truly think I’ve found the skates that are just right👌🏽 🙌🏽 I’m so happy rn that I still haven’t taken them off 😂

I see that the kingpin angle is around the same, and should be quite light weight.

158,newbie question,Rollerskating,"Hello everyone. Im new to all the roller skating frenzy but ive always been captivated by skating (it being skateboarding!, roller blading, roller skating, ice, you name it). And now ive decided to qctually buy a pair for myself. First of all, i know the differences between no heel and heel so I think ill go for a heeled boot. I have done my research, But theres a lot of questions i still haven’t answered.

First question is: is there any limitation between plates and brands? For example, if I buy suregrip, can I put a crazy skate plate on it or viceversa?

Second question is: what are the most customizable/upgradable brands? Or are they all the same? By that i mean switching between indoor and outdoor plates, switching wheels, etc.

Third: os there any differences between man and women skates? should i care?

I have found two pairs of used skates on sale for a great deal less than what they sell for new, and from what I've researched they are both solid options, but I need your experience and knowledge to help me decide!  


The two pairs I am looking at right now are [Ventro Pro Turbo quad skates](https://www.skatehut.co.uk/brands/ventro/ventro-pro-turbo-quad-roller-skates.htm) and Bauer Supreme One05 skates, which aren't sold new any more and I can't find the exact skates on an official skate site, but are basically converted ice skates. The Bauer roller skates I've found that are most similar to the ones I'm looking at are [here](https://www.olisskateshop.co.uk/Bauer-Quad-Skates/bauer-ns-quad-roller-skates).  


I will primarily be using my skates outdoors on regular paths, and I hope in the future I can learn to do more complex tricks and manoeuvres with them too, so whichever is best at giving a smooth, comfortable, durable and agile ride is what I think I'm looking for.

302,artistic wheel durometer outdoor skating,Rollerskating,"Hi :)

# I have ordered a pair of figure skates, but I am only gonna use them outdoors (at least for now!)

They come with artistic wheels and I chose the hardest cause the specifically said it was better for rough surfaces (aka concrete).

\&gt;&gt; Those I picked are HD84 (which after some research could be also labeled 58D).

Because they are ""D"" it means the material is different than the other classic wheels.

They are made of  ***Thermoplastic elastomere*** while most of the normal skating wheels are a mix of ***urethane*** (and use the A scale).

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at a comparaison chart, I couldn't even find an ""A"" equivalent of a 58D, but it could be around 105A (which seems crazy as the hardest wheels I have seen are 101A).

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt; I really don't know what to expect... has anyone used hard artistic wheels on concrete before ? How does it feel ? I am gonna slip like Bambi lol ? When I inquiered they said they might wear a bit faster because of the concrete's roughness 

**What does wheels wearing down means really ?**

I know you have to rotate the wheels to avoid ending up with different wheel sizes, but apart from that ? once the outside layer is gone, they are actually gonna become softer and have more grip ?

&amp;#x200B;

I own some radar energy wheels, which for sure make any ride smooth, but are dawn grippy and make my transitions/tricks look like I stepped on chewing gum.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt; I was interested by some Fundae (92A), which are described by a lot of people as ""ideal wheels"" cause they re hard enough to get a nice glide but still street friendly.

The thing is :

a) they are out of stock where I live

b) they are super expensive

The ""artistic equivalent"" of a 92/93A is HD43 wheels made by Komplex which ar literaly HALF the price.

^((I mean the Fundae are cute but if the cake costs 50€ extra no thanks))

I feel like if they are any close to a dupe that might be a bargain...I am just wondering if this Thermoplastic elastomere is sh\*t (hence the price difference) or it dosen't really matter ?

317,cold weather skate men chronic pain,Rollerskating,"Howdy! I have several questions so I figured I’d drop them all in one place instead of the discussion thread. 

Question 1) I live in the PNW. For chilly, non-ice days, should I dress how I would for a run? Layers, tight fitting clothes, gloves, etc? Does this impact how well my pads will work if (when) I fall? Cold is totally foreign to me (I’m from south Texas) so I’m trying to adapt all my activities. We have no rinks locally.

2) My spouse wants to join me on skates. I’ve noticed several brands don’t go up to his size (US mens 12). I’m willing to spend a bit more on his if I need to. $250 is what I’d like to keep it around, but I’ll raise the budget to get him good skates. 

3) we both have chronic pain conditions. While I know everyone is different, if you have a chronic condition, how has skating helped you? I have fibromyalgia, for instance.

What is the correct front to back and side to side spacing?

I own some nice Riedell boots that came pre-mounted with Neo Reactor. Personally, I don't like the Reactor plates, but that's for another story. 

I purchased some new plates to replace my neo reactors, but the hole mounting pattern is different so I need to drill new holes. I'm hesitant about drilling any holes until I know for sure that everything is aligned.

351,boot plate review roundup everything tried,Rollerskating,"About me:  I took up skating again last summer at age 51 as everyone else did during the pandemic. I grew up in the late 70s/early 80s skating on sidewalks and going to the roller rink but hadn’t skated since maybe 1984. 

[Me, my dad, and little sis in 82 or so.](https://preview.redd.it/subn0ge8rhh61.jpg?width=799&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69485d73cbfb237ee6c8db6f00bcf10c87460ec7)

I wear a size 7.5 to 8 in US women’s shoe/ 39 in Euro/ 5.5-6 in UK and fluctuate between 130 and 140 lbs. I am still trying to find the best set-up. I think it will be a Golden Horse Street Magic Boot with a Pilot Falcon plate.

**Boots**

My first skate was a purple **Jackson Vista** – high quality, well-made, well padded, comfortable and supportive boot, a tiny bit too high up my calf. I initially bought a size 8, which was fine to start with but then stretched a little bit so I sold those and my next pair were a (gorgeous) red size 7, which were perfectly snug.  Jackson Vistas come in women’s whole sizes only. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img nsk9tg0pphh61...*

[nearly perfect set-up](https://preview.redd.it/fjawj60pphh61.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c7627ecf38f0becef83598232488aba3789b76e)

After I sold my size 8 Jackson Vistas, I tried **Sure Grip Boardwalks** – these didn’t feel as nicely padded, well-made, or as supportive as the Jackson Vistas. They are stiffer than Lollys and maybe not as comfortable (I’m not sure since I didn’t keep them for very long). I loved the way they look on my foot, they came up to just the right spot on my calf, and I think if these had been the very first skates I’d tried out, I’d have kept them. The size 6 fit me perfectly (snug). These come in (men’s) whole sizes only.

**Moxi Lolly** – Compared to the Boardwalks, these felt really floppy and unsupportive which also made them more comfortable. I ordered a size 7 (as recommended) but it was nearly an inch too long for my foot. I have wide feet but they did not feel tight at all, just too long. I put blue Pilot Falcon plates on in place of nylon Powerdyne Thrust ones that came with them and ended up selling them to someone who loves them. I loved the way these looked on me, they had my favorite laces (a tiny bit stretchy and a beige color that goes with anything) which is why it took me so long to sell them. I even tried them with heel and insole inserts but they still felt too long. I didn’t keep these long enough to notice the reported tongue-sliding-to-the-side problem. They come in (men’s) whole sizes only.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img dqn0x03rphh61...*

**Riedell 297** – These are apparently for figure skaters and I adore the snuggly fleece tongue and padded support of these, there is just a little bit of irritation on my left (previously injured) Achilles tendon that I did not feel on other boots. It's also a tiny bit too high up on my ankle. The ankle area is very supportive but not too stiff. I did buy mine used and broken in, so I don’t know how these feel out of the box. These are said to be less stiff than the 336 model. The 6.5 fit me well. They come in half (men’s) sizes.

*Processing img b4phrj0ushh61...*

**Klingbeil** – I bought these as they were attached to a pair of plates I wanted (Roll Line Mariner). They were custom made in Queens, NY (company no longer exists under Klingbeil or in Queens) and while they fit like a glove and are gorgeous and well made, they are SUPER stiff. From what I’ve read, I think they compare to a Harlick boot. I cannot get down into a full crouch (as when doing shoot the duck) so I’m not sure what to do with these, they're on eBay if anyone is interested (as 2/14/21) They have a gel padded insert, and all kinds of tongue stays and hooks. I was told that proper lacing is required for these to fit well. 

*Processing img y4x4yfm9qhh61...*

**Golden Horse Street Magic** – these are semi-custom fitted to your foot. You send in a bunch of photos of your foot length and width measurements at different angles and let them know if you prefer a snug fit, a stiff/pliable tongue, have flat feet, need room to grow. They have a velour padded lining. Compared to Jackson Vistas, they have a little bit less support but more than Boardwalks or Lollys. They include two tongue stays (one at the bottom and middle of the tongue. These look a lot like Moxi Lollys but are more supportive and come in men’s half sizes and several different widths. Mine ended up being a 5.5.  Get a discount code for 10% off from u/kimmanningpacequeen on Instagram.

**Plates**

My first plates that came on my Jackson Vistas were Pilot Falcon plates and I think I was spoiled because after using several brands of plates, I am going to go back to these. They are aluminum and just as lightweight as nylon plates and come in several colors. 8mm axles, screw on toe stops with a side bolt that comes with an a hex adjustment tool. (see above picswith Jackson Vista skates)

Roll Line – I have a skate-obsessed friend who talked me into these, and while they’re gorgeous, made in Italy, they’re also expensive and have way too many adjustments for me to even learn about! The models I’ve tried (Mariner and Variant C) are very heavy compared to the Pilot Falcon plates. I think these are meant for figure skaters and I probably should have never tried them. Luckily, they are very easy to resell. 7mm axles, metric threaded toe stops.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img w33jsbe8shh61...*

Golden Horse – these “plastic steel” plates that came with my boots have a 360-degree truck (available as an option for about $20 if I recall correctly). I swapped out the cushions for the ones that were on my Powerdyne Thrust plates (from my Moxis) as the cushions that came with these seems made of a hard plastic.

The parks are dangerous or full of people that literally do anything to push you out of these spaces or get in your way. I am not a skate park skater, although I really wanna try, and like I just feel like since there isn’t a place like this rink outside, I feel like I haven’t really been motivated to use my skates that I almost feel like selling them which makes me extremely sad :( I live in southern CA so it’s really hard to go anywhere without the strict regulations (as there should be) and I feel hopeless that the pandemic will go not away any time soon.

- big wheel so its great for rough terrain

- gummy so its no trouble over rocks

Cons
- very tall wheel

- its alright for going over cracks
- not Bulky
- good for agility

475,convert mm axle allow mm bearing wheel,Rollerskating,"Hi everyone !

So I am putting everything together to get the perfect setting for my skates.

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking of getting artistic boots and the axles that come with them are 7mm but my bearings and wheels are 8mm.

&amp;#x200B;

When I asked the website they said because they are too big, the wheels will move...

&amp;#x200B;

What are the options ?

1. Getting 7mm bearings (but will they fit my outdoors wheels -fundae and radar energy 57- or will they be too small ?) EDIT: I have read on some other post that the external diameter of bearings is the same, what varies btw a 7mm and 8 mm bearing is the inner diameter. So basically any bearings will fit every wheels. Can anyone confirm ?
2. Special spacers ?
3. I saw what is apparently called ""axle sleeves"" which is a cheap plastic thing that convert your 7mm axles into 8mm ones...only issue ? I cannot find any in Europe and if I have to import them form US, the shipping is 3 times the cost of those plastic cylinders.... not really a good deal
4. Using the trucks from my old Impala. Those:

(But since Impala is bad quality I don't want to downgrade my whole setting)

&amp;#x200B;

What do you reckon is best ?

Does anyone have artistic skates and put outdoors wheels on them ?

498,lolly really worth,Rollerskating,"Hi everyone,

So like a lot of people I started paying attention to the Lollies from Moxi cause they became soooo popular. I've heard good reviews about them, but I have never tried them.

Not gonna lie, I also like their design.

&amp;#x200B;

But they are just out of stock, the only website which is selling them is EU won't get anything is my size before at least 2 months anyway....

&amp;#x200B;

So it got me thinking, are they so worth the money ? If seen one post lately on which people aren't super kind on the lollies...especially now that the company is starting to sell them at a higher price (business is business) due to the high demand.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be able to cruise, but mainly I want to get better at tricks (such as spining, small jumps etc...) I  really like the ""artistic skating"" moves (even though, realistically I won't be able to achieve same results).

&amp;#x200B;

I am really considering getting towards another brand now... like ridell maybe or even edea.

They have different price ranges, and I am assuming the ones around $350 have probably a better hardware than the stock lollies.

&amp;#x200B;

The only downside....well especially Edea aren't pretty (at least to my liking), they are standard for competition, but for outdoors practise it isn't really trendy lol

I am wondering if such white boots (which are probably made of some resistant vinyl, idk) are ""customable"", like could they be paint bombed ? Using acrylic paint or something ?

&amp;#x200B;

At least those are available [https://www.solopatin.com/fr/106-patins-patinage-artistique-pre-competition](https://www.solopatin.com/fr/106-patins-patinage-artistique-pre-competition) (they are in €, but price is similar, even lower to lollies in EU)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Is it better to just get Edea/ Riedell etc... and just invest into paint one the side ? For those who have them (especially if you have been using them outdoors), are the sturdy enough ?

during the last session the right-foot toe-stop broke off NEATLY and the seller didn't want to get me refund so i am now forced to keep and of course use them but have to remove the leftover piece of toe-stop stuck in the plate in order to do so.

i've tried glue-ing back the whole thing together but the thread is too far inside (like not even a millimeter but they don't reach).

Hi!! New skater here. I’m looking for some specific feedback. -warning, longer post. - 
I recently purchased a pair of skates with Moonlight Roller, after doing so I realized they had a different color I preferred so I contacted their customer service this morning asking them what my options were if they could alter my order or not. She said she can’t alter it but can cancel my order and I can make a new one. And since my skates weren’t even processed yet I’d get a full refund. However she said she had to forward it to a manager to get it cancelled and I didn’t want to risk the ones I wanted going out of stock so I went ahead and placed the order for them. 
Now I currently have two skate orders. 
I tried following up on their Instagram support just expressing I have anxiety and wanted to contact them just to get a quote on how long until I would receive a cancellation confirmation and they “read” my message and chose not to respond. 
I also stopped getting responses from the email once she said that she would forward it to a manager to have my order cancelled. Unsure if maybe their business hours end early? I mean it’s even thoughtful that I got responses from them on weekends in the first place which was amazing, so maybe they do half days? 
Either way I’m not upset with them since it is a Sunday I’m just rather nervous and have a lot of anxiety that I’m going to get stuck with 2 pairs of $300 skates, have to send 1 pair back, and be forced to eat the cost for shipping both ways because they made a mistake of not canceling my order in time. 
I was just curious if anyone had any experience with them of a similar situation to help me take a chill pill so I can relax. 
Also if you have skates from them how do you like them? I chose to get them over the moxi lolly’s cus they’re cheaper and because I’ve seen people waiting 4+ months for their moxi’s... and I know I like skating so I wasnt going to get a cheap pair first to replace it with a nicer pair later. I used to skate a ton as a kid

i live in atlanta, so the rollerskating community is very active, whether online at/or at parks. i go skating at least once a week because as a student, i have other extracurriculars and work to do. in the skate groups that im in, even the other students, are way older than me (21+). everyone else has a car to practice in the beginner areas while i cant do so as it's too expensive, therefore i can only practice at the advanced areas in atl which makes me hit a dead end. most of them skate everyday, making more progress and i can only skate once a week so it's no wonder that everyone is better.

while skating, men will make condescending comments and have an arrogant attitude. ive only bee skating since august. ive learned how to 180, jump (not the best), backwards 180, backwards skate, stall, but i cannot do transitions which most of our parks are based out of. i can carve a 10 feet wall but i cant even jump w/o being nervous. wtf??

the parks are also filled with teenage boys, and many are rude when you try to practice. ive been called a b!tch, talked about for no reason over than practicing, passive aggressively stared at (i guess to get out of the bowl), someone who i know was robbed there and nobody helped her out but my friend and i as a last resort, been catcalled, asked for my number too many times by grown men when im a teenager (19 and i look like it), asked to buy weed, just the whole nine. i love the park, but the people ruin it. it's the only park in the area that has vert which i looove since i dont care for transitions. yet, the drop -ins are too high and the crowd is horrible. ive gone during off-times, but i still have a mental block (and complex about everything) that i cant do anything.

this one guy made a weird comment about my assumed ethnicity  (im black), ive heard homophobic slurs from another teenager (still bothers me), and people got jumped here. the cops are always patroling because the teenagers do drugs and their adult friends supply them with it. 40 year old men...

all of my friends are like, ""dude, you can 180 in a 7 foot bowl and you just started) but it's so demoralzing seeing others skating for years make fun of you, give you unwanted advice, be called names for no reason. it's turned me off from skating as a whole. i havent done any of my other hobbies (reading, web coding, fashion, reproductive justice) since i want to be apart of something. i want to have a community and finally be good at something after being called stupid and worthless growing up by my family. it still eats at me and makes me want to succeed off the bat at everything because if not, im a failure. the teenagers being rude reminds me of my high school years. the men being men makes me want to cry because i have nothing to say back (rollerbladers ALWAYS)

i see others more advanced and it makes me wonder what's wrong with me? why are i not good enough? why cant i do anything right enough? 

i had a group of friends to skate with, but with winter, they either dont skate as often, have personal issues going on, or are unreliable (slow to reply, have another skate group, etc.).

i just wanted to rant. im stuck in a rut, thinking of selling my skates because of treatment as woman by skateboarders, men, my own complexes, etc. i wish i had just one buddy to roll with together. my learning is out of wack. i dont even know where to start from here on to get back on track.",past week ive really bad skating rut feel everything progress social life schooling stagnant ill focus

566,insanity buying moxi skate,Rollerskating,"Just for fun, I wanted to share how insane and a little silly I feel about buying Moxy Beach Bunny skates because I'm sure a lot of you can relate.

So I'm a newbie skater and even though I figured out pretty quickly that my $50 skates weren't gonna cut it, I still haven't really found a good place to skate. I'm basically a newbie living room skater haha.

And yet I got so obsessed with buying Moxis that I jumped at the chance when I found some in stock on [https://rollerskateshop.com/](https://rollerskateshop.com/) (I'm sure the fact that they're in high demand everywhere made it impossible to resist buying them).

They were a little more expensive (about $275) but I figured since I'm in France and would have to ship them from a foreign retailer anyway, the cost is approximately the same buying them a little more expensive from a UK store but with free shipping. And then, because of freaking Brexit, I got hit by an additionnal $70 customs tax that I didn't anticipate.

Now I feel even more stupid buying crazy expensive skates that I will use in my living room. I blame this awesome sub ( just kidding😉).

Oh well, at least they shipped them in 24 hours and now I feel obligated to myself (EDIT: and to you all waiting for Moxi skates) to brave the overcrowded streets of my city to become a master roller skater.

571,longer shorter wheelbase park skating bont sunlite plate,Rollerskating,"Hello! I recently ordered some bont parkstars with sunlite plates, but they won’t be mounted until I get a chance to try them on. My local skate shop ordered both a 5 and a 5.5 in the bont boot in case one of them doesn’t fit. The size 5 boot would have a size 3 plate and the size 5.5 boot would have a size 4 plate. 

However, they mentioned the size 5 boot could also have a size 4 plate if I want a longer wheelbase. I see that this provides greater stability for park skating, which sounds good. But are there cons to having a longer wheelbase? This setup will only be used for park + aggressive skating btw. 

Context: 
I currently have suregrip boardwalks, size 6 boot and size 4 rock nylon plate (239mm). These feel fine and great at the park! In comparison though, a size 4 sunlite plate is 248mm, which is 9mm bigger than my current plate. The size 3 sunlite plate is 233mm, which is 6mm smaller. 

They both feel like a significant difference... especially if my bonts are going to be at least a half size smaller than my boardwalk boot. I’m interested to hear if anyone has any experience w/ upgrading plates &amp; choosing between a standard plate rec and longer wheelbase for a park setup. 

Thanks!

605,experience custom van skate,Rollerskating,"I recently got a pair of custom Vans skates assembled by Empire Skates and I wanted to make a post detailing my experiences with the skates and with Empire as a store (spoiler: they are great).

Skates: Skating with the heelless skates are different coming from skating with heeled skates. The lack of a heel is noticeable immediately as your weight distribution is wonk. I got used to it very quickly though. I wear a size 8 in Vans with the thin stock soles and my feet typically have room to go forward a bit but with the aluminum insole and stock Vans soles, it was a nearly perfect fit. Just barely scrunched at the top but still comfortable for long sessions. My feet felt significantly raised and the shoe gets narrower at the top. If you wear Vans that fit perfectly, I would recommend getting a half size higher if you intend to use the stock soles. I don't think the thin aluminum plate will raise your feet any meaningful amount but the stock ones I had were pretty thick so they lifted my feet a lot. My feet are very high and wide so I could just barely get the laces tied and I struggled to get my feet into the shoes. I felt an uncomfy pressure on the sides of my feet but I think longer laces will fix that (hopefully). Wasn't too bad to deal with over a long sesh.

Empire Skates: 10/10 would recommend. Super nice employees both times I went. They currently only allow one group of two at a time inside the store so the wait can be a bit long (waited for 35 minutes my first visit) but going to rad coffee next door while my gf waited in line made it better (get the Frankenstein drink I could write a whole post on it alone perfect texture and sweetness). The cost of the assembly was $65 including a $10 upcharge cause the soles in the shoe were glued and those are hard to take off. I purchased everything beforehand and dropped them off. Took 3 weeks to complete cause they don't do assemblies during store hours as they are super busy. Great prices on skate supplies and the chill staff have made this my go-to spot, worth the 40 min drive from OC.",recently got pair custom van skate assembled empire skate wanted make post detailing experience skate empire store spoiler great skate part van refract sk hi footlocker link http www footlocker com product u dwn html source shoppingads amp locale en u amp sid amp inceptor amp cm mmc paid search google g pla dpa p prospecting pla u dwn amp gclid cjwkcaiajesabhapeiwaqfxurrhkqnlaoxxfqc jdstkglmgjdjqsdecfabs palymcapxl bocctqqavd bwe amp gclsrc aw d avanti magnesium plate suregrip fame wheel rollerbones bearing aluminum insole rollaround etsy http www etsy com listing pair aluminum insole custom van ref yr purchase posted insta http www instagram com p ckze nibaso utm source ig web copy link lol skate skating heelless skate different coming skating heeled skate lack heel noticeable immediately weight distribution wonk got used quickly though wear size van thin stock sol foot typically room go forward bit aluminum insole stock van sol nearly perfect fit barely scrunched top still comfortable long session foot felt significantly raised shoe get narrower top wear van fit perfectly would recommend getting half size higher intend use stock sol think thin aluminum plate raise foot meaningful amount stock one pretty thick lifted foot lot foot high wide could barely get lace tied struggled get foot shoe felt uncomfy pressure side foot think longer lace fix hopefully bad deal long sesh empire skate would recommend super nice employee time went currently allow one group two time inside store wait bit long waited minute first visit going rad coffee next door gf waited line made better get frankenstein drink could write whole post alone perfect texture sweetness cost assembly including upcharge cause sol shoe glued hard take purchased everything beforehand dropped took week complete cause assembly store hour super busy great price skate supply chill staff made go spot worth min drive oc,"['recently', 'got', 'pair', 'custom', 'van', 'skate', 'assembled', 'empire', 'skate', 'wanted', 'make', 'post', 'detailing', 'experience', 'skate', 'empire', 'store', 'spoiler', 'great', 'skate', 'part', 'van', 'refract', 'sk', 'hi', 'footlocker', 'link', 'http', 'www', 'footlocker', 'com', 'product', 'u', 'dwn', 'html', 'source', 'shoppingads', 'amp', 'locale', 'en', 'u', 'amp', 'sid', 'amp', 'inceptor', 'amp', 'cm', 'mmc', 'paid', 'search', 'google', 'g', 'pla', 'dpa', 'p', 'prospecting', 'pla', 'u', 'dwn', 'amp', 'gclid', 'cjwkcaiajesabhapeiwaqfxurrhkqnlaoxxfqc', 'jdstkglmgjdjqsdecfabs', 'palymcapxl', 'bocctqqavd', 'bwe', 'amp', 'gclsrc', 'aw', 'd', 'avanti', 'magnesium', 'plate', 'suregrip', 'fame', 'wheel', 'rollerbones', 'bearing', 'aluminum', 'insole', 'rollaround', 'etsy', 'http', 'www', 'etsy', 'com', 'listing', 'pair', 'aluminum', 'insole', 'custom', 'van', 'ref', 'yr', 'purchase', 'posted', 'insta', 'http', 'www', 'instagram', 'com', 'p', 'ckze', 'nibaso', 'utm', 'source', 'ig', 'web', 'copy', 'link', 'lol', 'skate', 'skating', 'heelless', 'skate', 'different', 'coming', 'skating', 'heeled', 'skate', 'lack', 'heel', 'noticeable', 'immediately', 'weight', 'distribution', 'wonk', 'got', 'used', 'quickly', 'though', 'wear', 'size', 'van', 'thin', 'stock', 'sol', 'foot', 'typically', 'room', 'go', 'forward', 'bit', 'aluminum', 'insole', 'stock', 'van', 'sol', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'fit', 'barely', 'scrunched', 'top', 'still', 'comfortable', 'long', 'session', 'foot', 'felt', 'significantly', 'raised', 'shoe', 'get', 'narrower', 'top', 'wear', 'van', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'would', 'recommend', 'getting', 'half', 'size', 'higher', 'intend', 'use', 'stock', 'sol', 'think', 'thin', 'aluminum', 'plate', 'raise', 'foot', 'meaningful', 'amount', 'stock', 'one', 'pretty', 'thick', 'lifted', 'foot', 'lot', 'foot', 'high', 'wide', 'could', 'barely', 'get', 'lace', 'tied', 'struggled', 'get', 'foot', 'shoe', 'felt', 'uncomfy', 'pressure', 'side', 'foot', 'think', 'longer', 'lace', 'fix', 'hopefully', 'bad', 'deal', 'long', 'sesh', 'empire', 'skate', 'would', 'recommend', 'super', 'nice', 'employee', 'time', 'went', 'currently', 'allow', 'one', 'group', 'two', 'time', 'inside', 'store', 'wait', 'bit', 'long', 'waited', 'minute', 'first', 'visit', 'going', 'rad', 'coffee', 'next', 'door', 'gf', 'waited', 'line', 'made', 'better', 'get', 'frankenstein', 'drink', 'could', 'write', 'whole', 'post', 'alone', 'perfect', 'texture', 'sweetness', 'cost', 'assembly', 'including', 'upcharge', 'cause', 'sol', 'shoe', 'glued', 'hard', 'take', 'purchased', 'everything', 'beforehand', 'dropped', 'took', 'week', 'complete', 'cause', 'assembly', 'store', 'hour', 'super', 'busy', 'great', 'price', 'skate', 'supply', 'chill', 'staff', 'made', 'go', 'spot', 'worth', 'min', 'drive', 'oc']",302

Props to the guard, who said he saw nothing wrong with me being there and seemed to genuinely feel bad about kicking me off.

Now I’m just upset though bc it’s been super beneficial to have this area to practice things in. Skating in the street I can’t as easily practice harder things due to bumpiness and the slope of the ground. Now I regret staying the extra 15min or so that I did today, maybe if I had left earlier like I originally planned I wouldn’t have been kicked out like this 😭

668,metal plastic plate outdoor park skating,Rollerskating,"Hiya! So a few weeks ago I ordered Chaya Melrose Elite skates, but I heard today it’s going to take until MARCH until they arrive! 

I have an option to get skates that will come really quick. These are Chaya Melrose Supreme Classic Dance (all black). They are a bit more expensive but it’s okay. The advantage is that these ones have adjustable toe stops. They don’t have aluminum plates like the Elites though.

I’m planning on just skating &amp; cruising around outdoors on smooth bike paths or slightly bumpy roads. No park. I weigh like 65kg. I thought that aluminum would be better because they are more durable and I really don’t want them breaking haha

I looked on the wiki but there wasn’t much on specifically outdoor skating with metal/plastic plates.

But now I’m not sure. So what do you think? Wait for Elites, with aluminum plates but no adjustable toe stops? Or swap for Supreme Classics with nylon plates and adjustable toe stops? 

Appreciate any advice so much! :)

692,changing hybrid wheel outdoor wheel make skating asphalt tiled path noticeably easier,Rollerskating,"I started skating a few weeks ago with my Rio Roller skates and I'm having so much fun. However, the wheels on my skates are hybrid wheels with a hardness of 82A, and I've only been able to skate comfortably on tennis courts and concrete floors (which are few and far between!). I tried skating on asphalt but it was horribly uncomfortable and I had to push real hard to go forward.

I was thinking of getting outdoor wheels so I can skate on rougher ground near my house, but I was wondering if outdoor wheels would make THAT much of a difference when skating on asphalt and tiled paths (like paths that have little square tiles on them)? Since I'm already skating with hybrid wheels, would changing to outdoor wheels make a noticeable difference? Or should I just suck it up and drive to nearby skate spots when I want to skate? 😅

703,wobbly wheel,Rollerskating,"I have a concern that I’m hoping someone will be able to answer for me. I’m a new skater (also new to posting on Reddit). I’ve been at this for about 1-2 months so far. I’m also a heavy individual, I’m at about 240-lbs.

I originally had Impala roller skates and I was getting the hang of my posture and doing a proper stride but than as I used them I realized that my skates started to wobble. One wheel hovered off the ground and spun around freely while the other 3 wheels touches the ground. I used them as is but I obviously struggled  since at that point the uneven trucks were pretty exaggerated and the wobble was noticeable.

In the end I decided to buy some Sure-Grip Boardwalks not only cause my trucks were uneven but just for a better over all skate, (adjustable toe stop, suede boot etc). When I first opened the Boardwalks I made sure to check they weren’t wobbly etc. I’ve skated in them a total of two times and I noticed that my left skate started to wobble just a bit and a wheel is now doing the same as the impalas. The boardwalks are double the price and the same issue is occurring.

I’m very very concerned now at this point. What’s happening? What am I doing wrong and is this something that I can fix? I usually skate at a public outdoor rink or I skate on the side walk at my local park. I use Radar Energy Wheels and my trucks aren’t super loose since I’m on the heavier side.

755,dancing without rolling backwards,Rollerskating,"Hi :)

So I started roller skating 4 months ago and I've recently decided to start incorporating some dance moves into my sessions. So far I can dribble okay and can also cross side step. I'm even trying to learn crazy legs. I'm doing okay footwork wise, but my issue is that I can't stay in place when I do these moves, I naturally and gradually roll backwards everytime I try to dance. It's really frustrating, I simply don't know how to fix this. As for the dribble, I figured I just have to be careful to keep my feet parallel and avoid doing an ""A"" shape, but it doesn't seem to be enough. I'd like to stay in place just like them : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvsDlcY0nPo&amp;t=325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvsDlcY0nPo&amp;t=325s).

767,complete beginner outside inline quad,Rollerskating,"Hey folks, I'm a complete beginner when it comes to any kind of skating. I ice skated once a year or so ago for an hour or two, and by the end of it was able to get my balance and glide for a bit, but that's the extent of my experience. I'd like to get a pair of skates to roll around my local area (suburban, sidewalks, parking lots, bike paths). My primary reasons for learning are recreational and to hopefully use them to commute in the future (no professional aspirations; I really don't mind even skipping tricks. I just want to be able to ride competently). I could see myself being interested in rolling around indoors as well in the future, but definitely not with COVID, so I'm really only going to focus on outdoor skating for right now. 

I apologize for another ""quad or inline post,"" but the majority of the ones I've seen so far had the OP already have some form of intermediate or advanced experience with a different kind of skate.

I'm looking at getting some new bearings. I know generally bones reds are recommended. How do these compare to moto deluxe bearings? (They're the same price). Are they any different or are they exactly the same? The motos come in a metal tube, that apparently is better than cardboard packaging as it prevents the oil/lube from being absorbed into it and they come ""pre-spun"" so don't have a break in period. That sounds good, but I can't find much in the way of reviews for them. I'm a newbie with stock bont bearings currently, so I don't have any experience with these things to really know if it matters.

798,rule self promotion explained,Rollerskating,"Hello everyone! We've had some confusion about rule 3, and I wanted to clear it up. Below is a (maybe too) detailed explanation of the rule, and certain situations you might find yourself in. As always all questions, comments, and concerns are welcomed!

*For reference, rule 3 is at the bottom of this post.*

**What is self-promotion?**

Any content that is posted for the sole purpose of getting views/selling an item or service. Some examples are posting a youtube video to get subscribers and views, posting a link to your skate blog, linking your store, telling someone where they can pay you for skate classes.

**Why don't we allow self-promotion?**

We want to cultivate a community where everyone is engaged. We also don't want the community to feel like they're getting ads shoved down their throats.

**What is the 9:1 ratio?**

We ask that if you're going to post outside social media links that you post on a 9:1 ratio. That means for every 1 outside link you have 9 discussions prompting posts, that can include posts and comments on other posts. What does not count toward your 9 is replies on your outside link posts.

The 9:1 ratio is in place for 2 reasons

&amp;#x200B;

1. To ensure that the poster is actually interested in the community and not just self-promotion. 	Those who just want to self-promote usually won't care about the rules to read them, and if they do it might not be worth their time to put in the 9. The 9:1 ratio helps us weed out those who are only 	interested in personal gains (self-promotion.)  
 
2. To promote discussion and engagement in the community. Discussion and engagement in the community are how we help other skaters grow and impassion new skaters!  
 

The more we engage with each other's content, the more likely we are to get on the front page and ***spread the love of skating***! I want everyone to find the peace that skating brings, and I'd have to bet that most of you do too!

**""I posted a picture of something I made and everyone wants to buy it now, what do I do?""**

Please always be mindful of how you present these posts so they don't come off as self-promoting.

&amp;#x200B;

* Not acceptable: ""I made this thing to sell on my Esty shop *NameofShop""*  
 
* Acceptable: ""I just made this thing""  
 

If you've posted an ""acceptable"" post, it will not be deleted! If you posted an ""unacceptable"" post, it will be temporarily deleted, reapproval will be contingent on rephrasing as to not be self-promoting.

If someone asks you if you have a shop or where they can buy it, please do not post a link to buying. You are more than welcome to privately message that person and let them know!

**""I want to post my Youtube videos, but I'm not self-promoting""**

We realize that sometimes it can be inconvenient to post to Youtube and then also post to Reddit, especially when you can just link Youtube videos. You're more than welcome to post outside links, as long as they follow the 9:1 ratio.

**""I want to post my TikTok videos""**

A TikTok video posted straight to Reddit will still have your handle in the bottom corner, because of this TikTok videos will also follow the 9:1 ratio.

**Notes about TikTok and outside link videos**

In addition to following the 9:1 ratio, videos must not appear self-promoting. An example of what would appear self-promoting: ""I just uploaded a new video to my Youtube/TikTok go check it out!""

**Other info and comments**

&amp;#x200B;

* If you ever have any content that was/is deleted and you don't understand why, please reach out through mod mail so we can explain why, and how to fix it.  
 
* If you are unsure if your post will be self-promoting please reach out to us; mod mail or personal will work! We are always happy to help out! We have a large mod team with all types of differing schedules, so will always get back to you within 24 hours at most; barring Reddit crash, or the insane possibility that we all have an emergency on the same day lol.  
 
* We don't believe that violating Rule 3 is a malicious act. Stuff happens! We will always give everyone the chance to fix content to be in line with Rule 3.  
 
* **Posts selling skates or other gear will be removed unless posted in the weekly Saturday skate market.**  
 

*Thank you all for sticking through this long read! As always, please reply or message us if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.*

**Rule 3. No self-promotion.**

“Posts linking directly to social media (IG, TikTok, YouTube, etc.) with the goal of getting views are strongly discouraged and may be deleted at mods' discretion. We want you to engage, not promote and run. We ask that you maintain a 9:1 ratio of participation in the sub (outside of your own threads) to self-promotion; repeated posts without further community participation will be removed.”",hello

824,minor tweak huge difference,Rollerskating,"Please excuse the dirt DX, years of working at sonic has done a number in these DX. 

I just finished doing a minor tweak on my Sure-Grip Boardwalk's that made a HUGE difference. I pulled the rivets that were holding the boot to the plate and replaced them with the bolt and nut. They are much sturdier now. I was given a pair of the Roller Derby Rewind's that were a half size to small for me that acted as a doner. Originally I was going to completely swap the Rock plate with the plate from the Rewinds but it was about half and inch too short.  

Now I need to get some suede cleaner, new bearing, new wheels, and possibly new plates/trucks to really take these boots to the next level. 

I'm planning on getting a new pair of skates and having theses as my back up pair since the tongue shifts badly in these.

829,adjusting truck,Rollerskating,"Hey there, only been skating for a month and trying to figure out the best way to adjust the trucks and wheels. 

When I got my first pair (impalas) I just started skating. Then I found you can adjust trucks. They were so tight to begin with it felt like I was dragging wheels sideways to turn. 
I have played around with them. I can move them easily (but not much) with my hands and I’ve read this is not good. 
Also they are a lot more unstable at speed, but I’m getting used to them. I find it easy to do tight turns and easier to skate in general. 

My questions is, is there some sort of standard to want them tighten to?
Should the backs be tighter or loser then the front? 
How lose is too lose and if I feel good skating with them like this is that ok or will loser trucks damage the skates. 

I want to invest in a good quality pair, but I want to work out all my mistakes with these first. 

Thanks for any help.

They just came in and I know some parts are the wrong size but I'm not sure what to do because I'm oddly proportioned. 

The wrist savers fit fine (hurt for a bit but I just had to move them and they were fine). And the elbow pads are a *little* tight when I bend my elbow all the way (as in bringing my hand to my shoulder) to my shoulder) but nothing unmanageable. 

However the real issue are my knee pads. You see I'm curvy/plus sized for my height and I used to be in marching band so my thighs and calves are....*squishy*.

I tried them on and instantly had lots on pudge and felt very restricted and frankly I looked ridiculous. I even tried having it just barely attached to the velcro by the very tip and it was still very tight. 

Will I need to just get the next size up? I'm worried my issue will be with the wrist savers and elbow pads being too big since my wrists are oddly dainty.

860,dumb question easier learn roller skating learned skiing kid,Rollerskating,"First of all - I’m a complete newbie, literally ordered my first pair of skates 10 minutes ago lol. Thanks to all the cool skater girls on Instagram :)

I’ve already read various posts on this forum regarding how to combat the fear of falling/injuring when starting to skate and also watched Dirty Deb’s video on learning how to fall (among several other videos), but I’m still very scared. 

I outright refused to learn inline/ice skating as a kid because I was too afraid of falling and breaking something and the one time I did go inline skating I fell on my butt and hurt my tailbone. 

So to calm my fears, I thought about sports I did as a kid/teenager and was good at and besides dancing the one thing that came to mind was skiing. I’m well aware that you can’t compare these two but some of the moves (bubbles) I remember learning in my early days of skiing.

869,comparison moxi lolly v moonlight moon boot,Rollerskating,"Hey y'all! I found myself in a wild position where I have a pair of moxi lollys AND moonlight roller moon boots (I thought my lollys would never ship so I snagged some moon boots, then, I kid you not, I got confirmation emails of shipping for BOTH within 10 minutes of each other). I need to send one back, so I figured I would lay out my initial thoughts of both for anyone interested in comparing and also ask you all: which should I keep?? :)

COMPARISON:

Disclaimer: I have not skated outdoors on these, just in my tiny kitchen, as I will be returning one. Also, I have been rollerblading since I was little so I know a good bit but am new to rollerskating. 

THE BOOT: Ok comparing the boot itself first, I have to say the Lolly definitely feels more quality. If feels a bit stiffer, like it will break in nicely and last a long time. Once laced up it feels really secure and stiff but form-fitting at the same time. It is, as many know, quite narrow. The Moon boot on the other hand is super super comfortable. My feet are on the wide side, so these felt like they were made for me. I might be leaning towards the moon boot just for the comfort. The leather is softer than the lolly (good for comfort, idk if that affects longevity?) and there is more internal padding. I also like that there is a little loop to put the laces through to keep everything in place. I've heard people say that the moon boot has more ankle support than the lolly-- I would argue that that is false! They are both equally flexible, but the lolly comes up a bit higher on the ankle. 

I should mention I am a consistent Women's 6.5 and I got a size 5 in both of these boots and they both were great. I definitely had a little more room lengthwise in the Lolly but it was so narrow that my feet felt held in nicely regardless. 

HARDWARE: The lolly wins here. The moon boot plate is surprisingly lightweight even though it is aluminum and I think the two weigh the same. I know this isn't very technical but things just look more secure and polished on the lolly (plate and trucks and such). The cushions are very hard on the moon boot, I would have to change that, and the wheels were very sticky on my hardwood floors for some reason. I got the lolly boot with fundae wheels, so that is not a fair comparison! So I put one shoe  of each booth with the fundaes on and actually, there wasn't a huge difference. I think the stock hardware on both of these isn't phenomenal, but definitely very solid, so although the difference isn't huge I would still claim the lolly as the winner. Also this showed me how important wheels are. (love the fundeas, by the way). One more thing! the highest point you could screw the toe stop up to is higher on the lolly and lower on the moon boot. I think I care about this because I primarily want to dance skate and would like the toe stop up high. I could always get a small stop or jam plugs I suppose.

HELP:

I want to keep both!! but they are way to similar and I do not have the money to justify that. going off of comfort, I would definitely choose the moon boot. I just like it and the shape was made for me. But I feel like the quality is just better in the lolly and I'm sure after some break in it would be good too. I really want the boot to last! I'm not the type to end up with a million pair of skates, I want one great pair that I love and can progress in. What do you all think?

876,need help building dream skate lt,Rollerskating,"Hi!

I'm an intermediate skater aiming to get more specialized in dance and rhythm skating by upgrading from my Beach Bunnies. I love 'em, but they're starting to look like hell and can't do what I want. I'm \*\*deep\*\* in research (this subreddit has been a lifesaver) and did lots of homework, but desperately need your expertise on some specfics!

The plan right now is to go with a quality but entry-level boot, focusing instead on investing in a great dance/rhythm plate I can later upgrade with a more top-level custom boot.

**Budget**: $250-$350

**Skate style**: Dance, with a mixture of some rhythm and artistic. Currently only have access to outdoors, so am set on getting Radar Energy 57mm wheels.

**Needs for the boot**:

* Either leather or suede, but padding + strong ankle support a *must* (so I'm assuming leather is best)
* A good amount of stiffness, so Lolly and other suedes are out
* Mid to high top, but not so high it impedes slide-y rhythm moves
* Scuff resistant since I skate outside and fall a lot :)
* Cuteness a big +, but I'm cool with going neutral then sprucing up with accessories
* Right now in between [**Reidell 120**](https://www.roller.riedellskates.com/Catalog/Roller-Skate-Boots/High-Top-Skate-Boots/Boot-Model-120-Award) or the [J**ackson Vistas**](https://skates.guru/product/atom-skates-jackson-vista-womens-roller-skate-boots-black/) (dubious of the suede but hear they've got decent support) but would love other suggestions! Love the look of Edeas (considered the [Waves](https://www.rollerskateusa.com/Edea-Wave-artistic-roller-skate-boot-p/edeaartbootwave.htm) but hate the pattern) and Risports but they don't seem great for any rhythm skating.

**Needs for the plate:**

* Durable but lightweight, delivers maneuverability without sacrificing stability
* *Not* riveted so I can use the same plate to upgrade to a better boot later
* Right now in between [**Powerdyne Neo**](https://www.rollerskateusa.com/Powerdyne-Neo-plate-for-Roller-Skating-p/riedellpowerdynereactorneo.htm) or [**Sure Grip Avanti Magnesium**](https://www.rollerskateusa.com/Sure-Grip-Avantir-magnesium-Plate-p/sgavantimagnesiumplate.htm)**.** Any other suggestions?

**Questions**

* Are any of the above plates riveted, which would prevent me from being able to upgrade the boot later?
* I've got tiny, pretty narrow feet. The Moxi Beach Bunny size 4 fits like a glove and was never painful. I can only find the Reidell 120's right now in wide, though. Should that be a dealbreaker?
* Any specific suggestions for bushings/cushions or are ABEC 5 OK? Same Q with bearings!

OK phew that's it I think! Let me know if you think or if I have any blinds pots in my research/thinking process!

881,riedell boot sizing help,Rollerskating,"I'm buying my first pair of adult skates and decided to get the Riedell Citizens skate set. I'll be buying online, so I am worried about getting the wrong size and going through the trouble of returning and reordering. I printed the official Riedell sizing guide for high top boots and did everything as follows and found my skate shoe size (length wise) to be the same as my regular shoe size, which I've heard people say shouldn't really happen. My feet measured at 10 3/8 inches. 

I also find it strange that on their official guide, the men's and women's sizes are almost exactly the same and are off by half a centimeter (see below). Would that just mean that adult sizes all go by mens length? It's not really a big issue but it did contribute to more of my new-to-the-roller-skating-world confusion. 

I've found mixed reviews about Riedell's sizing guide, and how some people's shoe size and skate shoe size not consistently matching to be bigger or smaller. So I just wanted to ask about all your experiences with purchasing riedell skates. What's your shoe size and what size do you wear/fits you in what riedell boot? Would you agree that it's more accurate to forget the whole shoe size to skate shoe size thing and just go by the inch measurement of your foot and buy according to that? And while I'm here asking, was the *width* size you chose accurate for your actual measurement or did it feel snug? Thanks in advance!

Also note: I am interested in all diff types of skating: dance, cruising, park skating. I want to try park skating especially, but I really want grind blocks before I do because when I practiced stalling the other day I scratched my plates.

Sort of a separate question: I see some skaters use harder wheels like fundaes when outdoor skating, and I am wondering if it is better with speed. However, I don't want to trip over every crack/pebble. But, then again I also feel more comfortable on skates so maybe I can handle it with speed and such.

903,antik skate switching heeled skate flat skate,Rollerskating,"Hi all! I'm currently skating on a Moxi Jack boot and have only ever skated on a boot with a heel. I primarily do park skating and have done all of my learning on boots with heels (and I'm familiar with both stiff boots and flexible boots.) What I'm *not* familiar with is skating on a boot without a heel. 

I am looking to save up for and purchase an Antik AR2 boot, which has no heel and is quite pricey. I am hesitant on spending so much money for a boot that is so different without knowing first how big the change will be. I looked into other types of skates I might want that are less expensive, but I determined that I would probably end up getting the Antik AR2's eventually anyways.

For those who use this boot or have switched from a heel: what kind of boot did you switch from? What is the most noticeable difference between heeled and flat skates? Was it something you could easily overcome and relearn at the skatepark or is it too much of a difference for you to use both?

It makes me infuriated that women are barely allowed space in a skate park and when at a public park, we still are pushed back into a corner, despite outnumbering them by almost 50 people. We are constantly made to feel like we're getting in their way and like we are not allowed to take up any space. It's disgusting, dehumanizing, and disrespectful on another level. I'm sick of the misogyny within the skateboard community that directly affects women practicing sports in public spaces.

What should I do in the future? I was so taken aback that I didn't say anything and almost cried (didn't though cuz I didn't want to give him the satisfaction). A friend spoke up for me and asked why he couldn't have done the trick on the other 100ft of concrete they were grinding on, and of course he replyed, bEcAuSe I wAnT tO dO iT \*HERE\*!

981,rolling wood,Rollerskating,"Just wanted to speak on my latest set of wheels, the Sure-Grip Original Wood Wheels. Just to get my story out there, I've been jam skating off and on for about 10 years and been through 3 jam skate (low boot, no heel, wider wheel, jam plug) setups. While the skating craze of 2020 inspired me to get back to it,  I wanted to try something different. I started eyeing high boots w/heels and different dance skate styles (JB).  Purchasing a new set of skates were out of the question being that none were in stock anywhere. 
 My next move was to switch out different components which started with wheels.  Rollerbones team logo (98a) ended up being my wheel of choice and what a change it was.  The wheel was so much smaller and narrow; it took weeks to get use to. Being that they were harder than my last set they rolled smoother and longer with less effort.  I did notice that while the rollerbones gave me a smooth, silk on wheels feel they gripped more than my older, worn down jam wheels. 
After days of research and questioning all the rink skaters,  I realized what I needed was a set of wheels with more ""slip."" I found Sk8Fanatics website to be the best tool for my research.  Their descriptions of slip to grip lead me to lean towards the original sure-grip wood wheels (not maple).
Some will call it a strike of luck, but I was blessed to win a set of VNLA V-Lines (high boot w/ heel) from RollerSkateNation. Coming from a broken in short boot I felt restricted in my new skates, not to mention the heel made me feel as if I was learning forward. It's been about a month and i still feel a lil funny stepping in them.

986,mental blockage skatepark,Rollerskating,"TW: depression and negative talk

I can't help but to be extremely frustrated with my progress. I went to the skatepark today after about two weeks without going, and couldn't help but to feel disappointed in myself (biggest understatement, I struggle with depression and felt a lot worse than that, but let's go with it) when I couldn't go down the easiest ramps that I've been going down easily for over a month. 

I understand that going down ramps is scary, and that it takes time, and so and so, but to me..... It's frustrating because I KNOW I can do it. I KNOW. I'm not just talking about today, on the ramps that I've done, but even the ones I haven't done... I'm so SO SURE I can go down them without a problem, but I just don't. I literally almost vomit out of fear and in the end I still don't go down. 

I've been skating at the skatepark for almost 5 months, basically everyday, for at least 3 hours but sometimes as much as 8, and haven't been able to go down over half the ramps at the park. There is so much I want to be able to do, but I can't help but to be heartbroken at how discouraged I always am. Always so scared, and ashamed of it. I can't help but to compare myself to everyone else, and I started with other friends who are just so ahead of me that I eat the dust from their running in front of me. I don't even talk to the other skater girls at the park, or skate with any of my local CIB girls because I keep wanting to improve so I can at least do the minimal (drop in and carve), but I can't even go down straight ramps.

People keep telling me all sorts of things: ""distract yourself so that you catch yourself by surprise"", ""don't stare at it before going down"", ""just throw yourself"", ""roll yourself so fast that you can't stop yourself last minute"", but in the end, my mind still doesnt allow me to succeed. I still stand on top of a ramp for over an hour, trying to tell myself that I can obviously do it, that I'm a badass, to stagger and squat, ALL THE THINGS I DO NORMALLY AND EASILY, but instead of encouraging myself into bravery, I just end up getting sick from the fear and then crying. (no wonder I only ever go to the park at night.)

How do people just go and do it??!? I just want to get the courage to try, I dont even care if I fall. But apparently I do care if I fall, considering I'm too scared to go down it!!! I can't even explain it at all.",tw depression negative talk help extremely frustrated progress went skatepark today two week without going help feel disappointed biggest understatement struggle depression felt lot worse let go go easiest ramp going easily month understand going ramp scary take time frustrating know know talking today ramp done even one done sure go without problem literally almost vomit fear end still go skating skatepark almost month basically everyday least hour sometimes much able go half ramp park much want able help heartbroken discouraged always always scared ashamed help compare everyone else started friend ahead eat dust running front even talk skater girl park skate local cib girl keep wanting improve least minimal drop carve even go straight ramp people keep telling sort thing distract catch surprise stare going throw roll fast stop last minute end mind still doesnt allow succeed still stand top ramp hour trying tell obviously badass stagger squat thing normally easily instead encouraging bravery end getting sick fear cry wonder ever go park night people go want get courage try dont even care fall apparently care fall considering scared go even explain,"['tw', 'depression', 'negative', 'talk', 'help', 'extremely', 'frustrated', 'progress', 'went', 'skatepark', 'today', 'two', 'week', 'without', 'going', 'help', 'feel', 'disappointed', 'biggest', 'understatement', 'struggle', 'depression', 'felt', 'lot', 'worse', 'let', 'go', 'go', 'easiest', 'ramp', 'going', 'easily', 'month', 'understand', 'going', 'ramp', 'scary', 'take', 'time', 'frustrating', 'know', 'know', 'talking', 'today', 'ramp', 'done', 'even', 'one', 'done', 'sure', 'go', 'without', 'problem', 'literally', 'almost', 'vomit', 'fear', 'end', 'still', 'go', 'skating', 'skatepark', 'almost', 'month', 'basically', 'everyday', 'least', 'hour', 'sometimes', 'much', 'able', 'go', 'half', 'ramp', 'park', 'much', 'want', 'able', 'help', 'heartbroken', 'discouraged', 'always', 'always', 'scared', 'ashamed', 'help', 'compare', 'everyone', 'else', 'started', 'friend', 'ahead', 'eat', 'dust', 'running', 'front', 'even', 'talk', 'skater', 'girl', 'park', 'skate', 'local', 'cib', 'girl', 'keep', 'wanting', 'improve', 'least', 'minimal', 'drop', 'carve', 'even', 'go', 'straight', 'ramp', 'people', 'keep', 'telling', 'sort', 'thing', 'distract', 'catch', 'surprise', 'stare', 'going', 'throw', 'roll', 'fast', 'stop', 'last', 'minute', 'end', 'mind', 'still', 'doesnt', 'allow', 'succeed', 'still', 'stand', 'top', 'ramp', 'hour', 'trying', 'tell', 'obviously', 'badass', 'stagger', 'squat', 'thing', 'normally', 'easily', 'instead', 'encouraging', 'bravery', 'end', 'getting', 'sick', 'fear', 'cry', 'wonder', 'ever', 'go', 'park', 'night', 'people', 'go', 'want', 'get', 'courage', 'try', 'dont', 'even', 'care', 'fall', 'apparently', 'care', 'fall', 'considering', 'scared', 'go', 'even', 'explain']",183

I'm planning to start with the Chicago 800s, and have the following questions. I would appreciate your wisdom and guidance here, lol. I'm trying to keep this as budget friendly as possible!

1. I've read posts saying to replace bearings and wheels at the very least. I like the Sonar Zens 62x32mm. I saw a lot of recs for Rollerbone bearings, but I'm not sure what size to get. 
2. Tools - what tools will I need to make my safety upgrades? I saw a lot of recs for a Y tool, but can I get away with a standard toolset?
3. Toecovers - what are they? Are DIY ones as effective? Do they work in addition to the toestops or in place of them? Do I need new toestops?
4. Safety gear - what do you recommend, keeping budget in mind? I have a Schwinn bike helmet, will that work?
5. Painting skates - I want to paint my skates to customize them. I saw that a lot of people used acrylic paint. Won't this crack? Is there a specific type of paint to use or a specific type of sealant?
6. Any other advice for a first-timer?

I had taught myself to 'pick a cheek' and lower myself to fall on my butt early on, and I was practicing something i nearly mastered indoors for the first time outdoors. 

But when i fell back on my butt this time, i instinctively put my arm out to stop my momentum so i wouldnt hit my back/head with as much force. My arm ended up staying straight instead of bending like normal and i heard it break before i felt it. At the hospital the doc said i essentially shattered my elbow into 4+ pieces ;; he also said i may never have the same range of movement in my arm again. 

I had to go into surgery twice and now i've got 2 metal plates in my arm, a whole bunch of screws, and am in so much pain now, worst thing is that its my right arm and i wont be able to work for several weeks/months.

I stuck to my culdesac, although I did go down a block and come back to get a pokestop. These are my take aways for other newbies

1. It felt like I was starting from square one with new terrain but by the end of it I was feeling it. 

2. I’m not comfortable with toe or t-stops outside, maybe someone more advance can give advice—they’re so bumpy compared to my smooth garage. Plow stops were my friend. 

3. Falling on pavement hurts 99 percent less than on the cement of the garage. I’m still aching from a fall 2 weeks ago and I fell once and today I felt nothing other other than the remorse of scuffing my skates.

1065,wheel bearing,Rollerskating,"Hello! I am relatively new to roller skating. I’ve been skating outside everyday, either doing 2.5 miles or practicing/drilling. I have a pair of Impala roller skates with the stock wheels and bearings on. I have been street skating, so the wheels have been fine so far. I’d like to try getting in the bowl at our skate/surf shop, but I hear it’s better to have harder wheels for ramps (92a at least). I don’t see any on Impalas site, but I did find some on Derby Warehouse. They are 62mm x 44mm, 97A, from Atom Stroker. I was wondering if anyone had a different suggestion or if they’ve used wheels from Atom Stroker before. 

My question about bearings: I know Impala uses 8mm bearings, but I’m not sure if I would need to get a different size when I get harder wheels. If anyone has advice on bearings, I’d love to hear it!

1071,got jiggly wheel slightly loosened,Rollerskating,"Is this odd? 
I saw on a video that you should tighten your wheels all the way and then keep loosening slightly until they have a good spin but not jiggly. I also heard that tightening them all the way stops the wheels from spinning. 

Well when I tighten them all the way, they still spin but not enough. So I loosen them a little bit and they make the jiggle noise and move. Is it normal to be a little jiggly or did I do something wrong?

1109,skate tip,Rollerskating,"Ive been skating for 6 years total lifetime. From teenager to old timer. I quickly put a list together of all the things I thought might help.

1. if you dont know why the top metal laces are hooks, google ""speed lacing""
2. if your wheels dont spin very fast, try brake cleaner or electronic cleaner, never use carb cleaner.
3. for a cheap way to carry your skates, buy a dog leash, fashion a slip knot on each end. (the metal hook, and the hand loop are built in, you just make the loops) then put the loops over the toe and first set of wheels. then carry over shoulder.
4. wear 2 pairs of socks and get gel insoles.
5. while skating, if you plan to exit the floor, or otherwise go in direction that might cause a wreck, point where your going, it will warn other skaters
6. i can do all same tricks in rental skates as my personal $60 chicago skates, youtube confirms the skate price isnt as important as adjusting them correctly (truck tightness etc)
7. the best upgrade in my opinion is new bearings
8. ask your local rink about punch cards or discount programs, it took me a year to find you they had 5 admissions for $20 punch card, i spent $7 every friday for a year+
9. protect your tailbone! basically try to learn to fall sideways, never straight down.
10. i wear 2 pairs of basketball shorts under my running pants, if i do fall and slide, it keeps your skin from gripping the floor instantly making slide falls much less painful. (coffin, shoot the duck tricks)
11. bring your tools to the rink in case your trucks or stoppers come loose
12. most tricks are easier to do going a little faster than trying them super slow. this is more of a good news tip for beginners.
13. if you dont like renting lockers, try to figure out a way to use a luggage lock to secure a back pack to something. usually theft is grab n go, if the thing they grab doesnt ""go"" they probably wont put in more effort.
14. stick a water bottle in your bag, most rinks (esp during corona) wont care if you drink water there, take bag to bathroom if you are worried to drink)
15. if you need a reason to replace your rink skates, your old ones can be your new ""outdoors"" skates
16. if you see a little kid fall on a busy night, dont skate around them, drag your stopper and slowly approach the  crash, providing a blocker for the little ones.
17. if your skate boot rips away from the base at the heel, dont use glue, get inside the boot with 1"" deck screws, i might have to make another post in detail on how to fix ripped heels. ripped heels can be fixed!
18. if you are trying to learn ""shoot the duck"" or coffin tricks, wear gloves, you can drag your hand on the floor some to help keep your balance til you figure it out.
19. if your wheels get dirty &amp; you cant seem to clean them well, you can ""resurface"" them at home with and angle grinder, just touch the grinder to the wheel softly, it will spin like crazy, and move it back and forth, it will take off a thin layer of material leaving not just clean, but a new surface.
20. if you skate at the rink regularly, try to learn a new person's name each time you go!

I would like an actual pair of indoor skates to cut cost on skate rentals at rinks and am wondering if I should just toos my cheap (they were like $60 from amazon) and get new indoor skates, upcycle my chicago indoor skates, or the hidden third option of do ing somewhat both ie paint my white chicago skates for kicks and buy a new (actual) pair of indoor skates.

I am a newbie! I want to change the stopper on a pair of C7 skates to something that is longer or closer to the ground. The stopper is too high, so your foot has to be angled dramatically to use it.

I think it is a bolt-on stopper.

Or could this problem be resolved by changing the wheels or adjusting the trucks?

Additionally, will any wheel with of same size be okay to use? I want to get softer wheels for it.

I read C7 is a decent skate for beginners to try and see if skating is for them, and I understand it's one you will have to graduate from later on.

1158,instagram trend irk,Rollerskating,"Just curious what other people think of these things, because they've been bothering me for a while.

For one thing there seems to be an emphasis in saying you haven't been skating for very long. Personally I think its at least as big an achievement to learn something gradually over years as to pick it up in a few weeks, especially when a lot of skaters who are doing spins and waltz jumps after one week clearly have a background in dance or ice skating.

The other one that kind of goes with this is the emphasis on skating every day. I skate most days but I honestly don't think its healthy to do the same kind of relatively strenuous exercise every single day. Your muscles need rest and that doesn't make you a less enthusiastic skater. Professional athletes need days off.

I feel like the combination of these two trends leads to this strange world where it feels like people are competing to do the most tricks in the shortest space of time and I honestly don't think that rollerskating needs to be a competition. I'm sure not everyone who does this has these views but it does sort of out me off rollerskating instagram.

Just curious if anyone else has the same iffy feelings about this.",curious people think thing bothering one thing seems emphasis saying skating long personally think least big achievement learn something gradually year pick week especially lot skater spin waltz jump one week clearly background dance ice skating one kind go emphasis skating every day skate day honestly think healthy kind relatively strenuous exercise every single day muscle need rest make le enthusiastic skater professional athlete need day feel like combination two trend lead strange world feel like people competing trick shortest space time honestly think rollerskating need competition sure everyone view sort rollerskating instagram curious anyone else iffy feeling,"['curious', 'people', 'think', 'thing', 'bothering', 'one', 'thing', 'seems', 'emphasis', 'saying', 'skating', 'long', 'personally', 'think', 'least', 'big', 'achievement', 'learn', 'something', 'gradually', 'year', 'pick', 'week', 'especially', 'lot', 'skater', 'spin', 'waltz', 'jump', 'one', 'week', 'clearly', 'background', 'dance', 'ice', 'skating', 'one', 'kind', 'go', 'emphasis', 'skating', 'every', 'day', 'skate', 'day', 'honestly', 'think', 'healthy', 'kind', 'relatively', 'strenuous', 'exercise', 'every', 'single', 'day', 'muscle', 'need', 'rest', 'make', 'le', 'enthusiastic', 'skater', 'professional', 'athlete', 'need', 'day', 'feel', 'like', 'combination', 'two', 'trend', 'lead', 'strange', 'world', 'feel', 'like', 'people', 'competing', 'trick', 'shortest', 'space', 'time', 'honestly', 'think', 'rollerskating', 'need', 'competition', 'sure', 'everyone', 'view', 'sort', 'rollerskating', 'instagram', 'curious', 'anyone', 'else', 'iffy', 'feeling']",98

1193,one thing helped constant neck back pain roller skated year,Rollerskating,"Just wanted to share my experience in managing chronic neck and back pain for close to 20 years now. I've tried almost every solution you can think of -- orthopedics, chiropractic, physiotherapists, massage sessions, yoga etc. but nothing ever seemed to work. I was desperate for a solution when a good friend recommended me these two products (am not affiliated to them in any way, just wanted to put it out there to help a fellow reddit friend) -- The first solution is a massage mat which derives its origins from an ancient Indian healing method which dates back to 5,000 years ago ([https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat](https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat)).

I have been park skating on suregrip park series trucks and while I love love love them there is one single thing that is a bit of an issue which is my block. I have the disco blocks which I purchased prior to the trucks and while theyre great to grind rails, my wheels drag too much on an ordinary coping to allow any slide :( I have the rollerbones wheels in 101a (57mm). 
My bf is a skateboarder and showed me these super tiny (39mm) 103a wheels made for skateboards and I am VERY curious about them and whether this could be a fun solution to my problem or an absolute disaster. I’ve heard you can put skateboard wheels on wide trucks but I’m wondering if this is TOO small. The wheels I’m looking at are the Boardy Cakes drip drop wheels (they’re out of stock everywhere I can find now but if this isn’t a terrible idea I might get them when they restock) If anyone knows anything about this or has done something similar or has an alternative solution to lower my blocks without having to buy a whole new set or change my trucks that would be amazing!

I drove to one of the many parking lots I've designated ""skate spots"".  My sister came with me to make sure I didn't die.  First impressions-
1. Wheels are....very very roll-y
2. My lower back needs to workout.  It's sore.
3. Always stretch before getting into your skates.  I immediately pulled a muscle when I was practicing falling.
4. I have new appreciation for baby animals that fall out of their mothers and are running on spindly legs within hours.  Baby giraffe, you're the real MVP.
5. Wear your helmet.  If my sister wasn't there, I might have a concussion.  I wouldn't be surprised if she hid my skates until I got one.
6. Don't be ashamed to admit you need something to hold onto while you learn.  I'm going to find some tennis courts.  Someone near mine is clearly trying to get their kid to Wimbledon.  Thus, it is always occupado.

I'm a first time skater who has no inline skating or ice skating or even exercise under my belt.

1221,went skating first time since kid,Rollerskating,"After buying my own skates nearly 6 months ago, I finally decided that it was time to go try them out yesterday! I went to a park nearby and promptly realized that there were SO many people, debated turning my car back on and driving home, then finally just put my skates on.

Then I realized that the seemingly gentle slope that the parking lot was on was actually the black diamond for roller skating newbies. Promptly took a fall and landed on my unpadded knee because in my anxiety, I forgot to put my kneepads on and then had to waddle back to the car to put them on. Within the first three minutes of putting my skates on, I got a huge scuff on the toe. A passing stranger hit up a conversation with me and wished me luck, then I was off!

I did take a gnarly fall in front of another stranger and stared up at the sky as he offered me some help, which was at once hilarious and embarrassing. I really didn't remember skating being so hard as a child! I also didn't fully understand that skating outside would be so different from being in a rink😅

Ultimately, it was a really rewarding experience as people kept jogging or biking past me to tell me I was doing good or that they liked my skates. I think back on younger me and wish I still had her fearlessness but I think I still do sometimes!

1239,starting new youtube channel,Rollerskating,"Hi everyone! My name is Isabel (Isa the Small) and I primarily do skateparks!

**I'm starting a YouTube channel** for my skating, and I should be posting my first video tomorrow night. I'll be creating things like tutorial videos, skatepark session edits, gear information and reviews! I know there are a lot of skate YouTube channels coming out right now, so most of the things I post will have lots of overlap with other creators... Having watched so many different videos from so many channels, I've seen the same trick be taught so many different ways and I'm here for it! I'm hoping to add my two cents and give new skaters even more content to browse through that might help them dissect their own skate style and tackle skills!

If there are any specific **videos you'd like to see or any skills that you'd like to have tutorials for**, please comment them! I'll be posting a link to my channel when I get tomorrow's video up. Tomorrow's video will be focused on a review of the new Estro Jen/Michelle Steilen Rollersbones wheels, comparing this new wheel to my last used skatepark wheel and some footage of the aforementioned wheels in action!

I hope you decide to join!

1275,stand still skate without falling desperately looking advice,Rollerskating,"Hey guys!

I'm going to start off by saying that I'm a complete noob when it comes to skating, but I've absolutely fallen in love with the idea of learning how to do it. I've been watching videos on how to skate and reading this sub, a few weeks ago I ordered Moxi Rainbow Riders! I finally got my skates in the mail and I'm so very excited, however:

 After adjusting the wheels and all, I finally put them on and tried to stand up proud and happy, ready for a challenge. Well, I guess I wasn't so ready after all, because as I stand up, I suddenly end up rolling either back or forth really fast and I can't control it without falling. Every time I try to stand, I don't even have the time to bend my knees before my feet start rolling away from me uncontrollably! so I don't even know how to get used to the feeling/properly find my balance, as soon as I stand up, I fall. As of now, I can only get around by using my toe stops hahaha!

Or, do you think I should just keep the impalas and learn on them before I have to trash them anyway in a couple months as everyone says they don’t last.

I’ve found that I progress much faster with tricks on my own in my basement than at a rink with others around. I get nervous and awkward and end up fumbling even moves I have down, because I can feel people watching me. 

Basically I’m at the stage where I’m good enough that people are watching and occasionally come up to me and ask how I do stuff, but I have so many footwork tricks that I’ve yet to master and when practicing those moves I don’t have the flow yet and end up looking stupid while people look on. My basement is relatively small and alll the indoor and outdoor rinks/spaces have people at them. I need a little more room to do some of the moves I want to learn but I get so uncomfortable when being watched.

Anyone else deal with something similar? How do you get over it?

So I wonder if it's possible to have one flat derby pair and one pair with heels for cruising, or if the two are so different that it's not recommended to learn and use both flats and heels at the same time, and that I should just go for one type (and get another flat pair for cruising)?

They took a week or so to respond but ultimately did and asked for photos, videos, etc. I followed up 3x over the course of a month before they said they could replace or refund. At the time I asked for a replacement and didn't hear back for another month (btw, they had 1-2 drops in that time). 

You get where I'm going with this but basically it's been four months since I started my inquiry and they have stopped responding to me completely. I've been nothing but kind to them so I can't imagine it has anything to do with that. I've also talked to their social media person who has said a few times that they'd pass along my request to CX.

1389,feeling really frustrated moonlight roller safety dance skate,Rollerskating,"Last year I pre-ordered a pair of Safety Dance skates from a local skate shop and was really excited to eventually receive them. However, the skates kept getting delayed due to manufacturing/shipping issues and COVID, which I understood. The local skate shop eventually informed me that the skates were discontinued due to defects and that they would issue refunds. Disappointed, I asked for a refund and thought that was that. 

However, since then, Moonlight Roller has announced a sale of the discontinued Safety Dance skates, through various iterations. They initially set up an eBay shop, which they abruptly closed down due to issues confirming they were a valid vendor on the site. Then, they decided to have an Instagram Live sale, which, as any of you can imagine, was messy and incredibly frustrating. The last time they mentioned anything about the Safety Dance skates was through their IG live sale, and they said they would have another one coming up after the holidays. 

Today, the local skate shop I originally pre-ordered the skates from shared a post on Instagram announcing that they had Safety Dance skates in stock. I unfortunately missed them again and they had sold out in my size. But what really frustrated me is that Moonlight Roller never shared anything on their social media accounts about skate shops restocking and selling the Safety Dance skates. I DM'd them on Instagram and asked them about if more would be sold, but they have yet to respond.

I know that I am not alone in still wanting a pair of Safety Dance skates. They are my dream pair, which is why I have been obsessively following Moonlight Roller to try and purchase a discounted pair. But, I feel like it's no longer worth supporting a business that has been disorganized, inconsistent and lacking full transparency. I'm not sure what else I can do besides messaging them and inquiring further. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this rant!

I hope to get more specialized in artistic, rhythm, and/or jam skating. Currently, I can only mostly skate outdoors on a gravel basketball court.

In terms of upgrading my Beach Bunnies — any suggestions for wheels that suit my above needs? Any other recommendation for upgrading that particular skate?

Outside of upgrading — what higher tier skates should I look into? I like a heeled, mid to high boot with a little stiffness for ankle support, and as much stability as possible without sacrificing maneuverability. I don’t love what I’ve heard about the Lolly’s suede flexibility. I’m also super into the idea of custom building my own but don’t even know where to start! Should I bother doing the crazy thing and saving up for Flaneurz. I don’t know!

1437,problem bubble,Rollerskating,"So I've had my skates for about three-four months now. My practice has been limited--I've got hallways, and two times out on pavement. I can go forward pretty well, stop multiple ways, turn (no transitions yet), and ofc fall. I honestly really like this, and I'm having a bunch of fun. However, there has been one thing that I'm stuck on: bubbles. For whatever reason, I can't successfully get them, and I've spent a bit of time working on them. I have the leg strength to pull them off, I've watched videos, etc. (Thanks, Dirty Deb!) 

My main problem is after my legs are out at the widest part of the bubble, I can't bring them back in. I'd also say that I have trouble building up speed, but first things first. There's only two things that I can think of off the top of my head: I have not been able to loosen my trucks (the skate tool bent immediately and I'm missing a socket wrench head) and my skates may be too large (I feel a considerable amount of 'give' when I push down on the boot before touching my feet). If anyone can suggest anything that I'm missing, please, please help me out--not being able to get the literal basics down is killing me here!

I've also heard sure-grips are good, but if I'm being totally honest they are not very cute and I have no idea where they're going with their sizes. Are they only in men's sizes???

But really though, I'm confuzzled. Will they end up in the ""Failed Hobbies &amp; Crafts"" closet? Will I slip and fall on my butt at Baskin-Robbins like I did in my dark childhood past? Is wanting to rollerblade the final sign that having a patchy beard is the only masculine thing about me?

1554,invest good protective gear,Rollerskating,"I love this sub because it seems most of you here have more common sense than in some of the Facebook groups. So this is just general advice and luckily from pics and videos here I already see many of you doing so.

INVEST IN THE BEST QUALITY PROTECTIVE
GEAR YOU CAN GET. If you’re just doing rink skating or skating on flat even pavement, you can likely do just fine with lighter gear. However, if you plan on going to the skate park, skating hills, or anything else more risky, invest in good gear. Looks are secondary to your safety. Luckily some of the good brands like 187 or Smith now have some colorful options, and both S1 and Triple 8 have cute helmets. But buy good stuff.

And also, learn how to safely fall. And practice doing so, even though that sounds silly. 

Last year I was hill bombing and majorly wiped out. Luckily I had all my gear on, and fell the right way. Still, the sheer amount of plastic scraped off the caps of my knee pads and one shoulder pad was a wake up call of how badly I would have been hurt without it all.

1560,glass wearer wear mask show way,Rollerskating,"Hello all\~

I want to first preface this by saying that I always wear my mask out in public and try really hard to do my part in this pandemic. I just want to make sure that's clear. Wearing a mask is really no inconvenience to me and pretty dang easy...Except for when I'm park skating :( Which brings me here, to ask for help, advice, and any other skater's advice (who also wears glasses) with this. I, as my title suggests, wear glasses. And when I'm skating, I skate hard. I really push myself, and as a result, my breathing gets heavy. So when I wear a mask, my glasses get incredibly foggy because of the exercise I'm doing, to the point where I cannot see and it's straight up dangerous. I can't see the skaters around me or even in front of me. I hate to say it, but I currently do not wear masks at skate parks (if I'm cruising on pathways or just jam skating, I do!) But what I've been doing is I just get to the parks really really early, when theres almost no one, and then I dip out as soon as people start to head in, because I know it's irresponsible. But I want to be more consistent with my park skating, because it's truly helped my mental health, but I also don't feel comfortable being at a crowded skatepark with no mask. So with that said, I would really appreciate advice from my fellow glass wearing skaters. How do you wear a mask with glasses while still being able to see? 

Ps. I know contacts are an option, but I'm not really in the financial position to buy some right now. But hopefully in a month, since I just started a new job with consistent pay.

A lot of accessories can end up getting damaged through falls/bails so dont feel too pressured. If you have the money and time to invest then go ahead and accessorize till your heart is content. 

Im not trying to be negative or trying to offend anyone who likes to accessorize for aesthetic purposes, at the end of the day we are all on 8 wheels having fun and looking cool regardless of what your skates look like.

1609,looking buy first pair skate,Rollerskating,"I’ve been doing a TON of research on roller skating since I got back into it. I’ve definitely found this to be something I am passionate about and I am super excited to keep learning and getting better. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to afford a pair yet, but I’ve I’ve been saving up and should be able to get a pair soon. In the mean time I’ve been using rentals at my local rink, but it feels like I’m re-learning how to skate every time. 

I’m interested in park skating and trail skating mostly, and of course at the rink. Obviously I am super into the Moxi Jack, but they are not easy to come by. I’d really like a leather boot, in a more neutral color, like white, tan, or black, and I would like something that would be durable for park skating.

1613,skater ya feeling age,Rollerskating,"Gonna turn 36 this year, just got into quadskating cuz of quarantine, never been on skates (other than inlines when I was 9), started in may, got into park skating in October. I can do basic stuff- drop in, stall, 180 out of the bowl, a weak half cab, however I am starting to feel my age. I  watch all these young'ins jumping and spinning in the bowl and I want to try them, but I am afraid of falling and breaking something, especially since I can't really afford to be off work due to financial responsibilities. I think its more the investment of time...do I really wanna dedicate time to ""unlocking"" skills in a hobby that I might have to give up in a few years. I'm thinking maybe I'll eventually stick to just carving around the bowl as I get older, and jam skating. Also, whacking your head on concrete, even with a helmet, isn't really healthy, just look at football players who have developed early-onset parkinson's/ dementia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic\_traumatic\_encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy)) .

1630,tip advice two foot spin,Rollerskating,"Hello! So I’m familiar with how to do heel toe spins, but I can’t figure out two foot spins!! I’ve seen so many skaters keep most of their wheels on the ground without lifting much of their heel or toes and it seems so effortless.

My end goal is to be able to spin multiple times in a circle but I don’t want to go as fast as heel toe spins make me go. It looks like two foot spins will give me greater control to spin slower... but needing advice/tips on how to the spins in the first place.

1714,wheel making outdoor skating difficult,Rollerskating,"Hey ya’ll. I am a brand new skater. My first few skate sessions have been in any empty room in my bf’s house on hardwood floors. I have sure grip fame skates and I was skating on the indoor wheels they came with. I’m pretty sure they are 52mm, 95a hardness. For my first outdoor skate session, I put on the moxi gummy wheels. They are 65mm, 78a hardness.

While skating indoors on the fame wheels, I was actually pretty quick to learn how to transition. I was doing C turns fairly easily. It was also super easy to gain momentum indoors. I had to actively prevent my speed bc I was in small spaces. This totally changed when I was outside today on the moxi wheels.

I noticed I did not get as much momentum skating outside on the moxi wheels (I was on an outdoor roller rink, concrete, it was cracked up in many places but the cracks never seemed to trip me). I also couldn’t really transition at all. No C turn. I would trip or my wheels would skid. I could feel how grippy they were. I also had to try really hard to keep momentum when drilling forward and backward bubbles while it seemed so easy to move indoors.

Just to add, my bearings where the sure grip abec-5 bearings that came with the fame wheels. I took them out of the indoor wheels to put on the moxis. After skating, I put those bearings back into the fame wheels and put some bones red bearings in the moxi wheels. I wonder if this will help with the momentum? I’ve also been making sure the nuts aren’t too tight on the wheels, so I don’t think it’s that either. Is my difficulty due to the chunkier wheels?

When I turn to transition, I have got into the habit of leading with, and placing weight on, my outer leg in order to swing round.

Is there a right/wrong way to turn or is using both the inner and outer leg to lead in a turn ‘ok’?

Turns out I love spending time with myself and sometimes those hobbies require external socialization. I’m way happier than I’ve ever been. I decided to try roller skating and got an entry level pair of rio-rollers.

I don’t know what my long term skating goals are yet, and I’m limited to my garage until the weather gets better, so I’ve been working on stopping, falling, balancing, bubbles and just going in circles.

1841,advanced trick gummy wheel concrete,Rollerskating,"Hi everyone, 😉 

I exclusively skate outdoors and have the Radar energy 57. 

I manage (kinda) to do 2 foot spins, also I am still a newbie at it.

I noticed that the most rotations I can do is usually 3. Whereas when you see videos, coaches teach you on hard floor/ slick wheels and their moves seem way smoother and they can turn for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

I try my best to pick spots where the concrete isn't too bad but there will always be a ""grainy"" feel to it.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to 3 turns, 1 foot spins (2 foot spin to a 1 foot spin or just 1 foot spin directly) can they be performed fairly easily on concrete with soft wheels ? I understand that you get the best results indoors (hence why figure skating is done on hard floors), but is it still possible ?

I do struggle with my 3 truns and while my technique is not 100% on point, I wonder if it can be a limiting factor

1879,backwards rexing music associated style skating,Rollerskating," \*Roller Skate songs for REXING\* A compilation of songs that were used for competitive rexing. You can view what it looks like in this video. h[ttps://www.facebook.com/whateverlew/videos/10204467963279004](https://www.facebook.com/whateverlew/videos/10204467963279004)

Rexing is a style of skating done backwards in an hour glass pattern on the skate floor. That form of skating started in the late 40's in San Diego, California and became an organized, competitive sport by Big Monty and Ginger Lewis. The music that was used to compete was organ music but as the years passed young people wanted to upgrade the music. The powers that be pushed back and wanted to keep it organ music until they finally succumbed to the pressures of the young. But by the time that happened it was already into the late 70's. Specific non-organ music was eventually included but it was at a very minimum with artists like Booker T and a song called Kansas City which became the standard to the rhythm of that style of skating. 

By the time the 80's rolled around the young people had taken over the style of skating and changed the music. Of course against the wishes of the old timers that started the competitions. But couldn't deny the changing of the times. In this mix, ""Roller Skate Songs for Rexers"" I have put together some the songs that were used for the competitions and if you notice more 80's than any genre of music. I saved the old, OLD organ music for last to represent what the music was when it started. 

There was a generational problem with that style of skating as time when on.  Since the skating pattern was in an hour glass regular session skaters wouldn't know about it and get in the way of the rexers and the rexers would get pissed. So the skating worlds collided, LITERALLY. Now it's almost non existent with the only people doing it are those trying to hold on to the past and that fun form of skating. AND all of those skaters are over 45 years old or older. I know because I am one of them. I skated competitively in the 80's when it was at it's peak taught by one of the best, Geri Goodman. The source of some of this info was provided by Carol Craver. Carol and her husband Butch Craver owned Rollerskateland in Santee California.  Well without further ado, here is the compilation of the music used for backwards rexing. Enjoy.

1892,advice skating,Rollerskating,"Hi !!

During March I started roller skating! I loved it but three months in (June) I sprained my ankle (3rd degree I think) and I STILL haven’t recovered 

My ankle feels like a loose teeth  like it’s there but it could break if I do a wrong turn or something. It gets uncomfortable in the cold and it just sucks.

I’ve qcceptee that it won’t ever feel as strong as it used to but it makes me so sad when I try skating again and I make it so stiff in fear or spraining it

I also verly skate and when I do my ankle is uncomfortable while and after skating

However, 

Should I even bother skating anymore?! Is it safe ?! Is it worth even though my ankle stops me from improving? Or am I just scared?

Really; I’m horrible at explaining I just wanted to rant because it was my one form of exercises that I loved and I loved falling and trying new tricks. 

Now; my skates are as beat up as my ankle.

1910,sizing question high arch sure gripboardwalk,Rollerskating,"I am a beginner getting back into skating.  I skated as a kid-- I was never great at it. I will be skating outside over rough pavement, and I am planning on buying boardwalk skates.  I need sizing help from people who have used the Sure-Grip Boardwalk skates, and especially people with high arches..

In regular women's shoes I am a size 8.5 to 9 depending.  I have a very high arch, and so that can sometimes shove my foot forward in an 8.5 or make the top of the shoe near the ankle be too tight, requiring that I size up to a 9.  I measured for the Sure-Grip boot and I am 151mm that would put me pretty much right smack dab in the middle of a size 7  without accounting for the fact that I have a high arch.  Do you think I should size up to an 8 (there are no half-sizes)?  or do you think that the cut of the boot is accomadating enough to fit a high arch okay?

The sizing chart reads:

**Sure-Grip Size          Foot Length (mm)**

**4**                                  229

**5**                                  239

**6**                                  247

**7**                                  254

**8**                                  264

**9**                                  272

Posting here to ask all of you who are experienced skaters- what’s worked for you all recovering/rehabbing an injury like this? I’ve done ice/painkillers and am totally taking it easy, are there any stretches or exercises I should be doing to speed up healing, or things I can do to minimize the pain like certain positions or something?

I badly bruised both hips a couple days ago, I lost my balance on a crossover with some speed on the left and then went over the stopper on my way to take my skates off and hit the bone right on the step in my garage where I was practicing. Needless to say, I had no idea your hips are this essential to you body... because every movement definitely uses them 😅, but what’s bothering me the most is my lower/mid back has been really sore since, and it’s really hard to find a comfortable position that isn’t putting pressure on an injury. My partner’s been doing light massage to try to relieve the back pain, but it hasn’t helped at all and my back (especially the lower back) actually hurts more after a massage.

1937,central park nyc roller skate experience,Rollerskating,"Hey now, it's me back again bringing you up to speed on what's crackin with skate music. First, if anyone has any questions about the specific genres of skate music feel free to ask away. In the meantime this mix is called  \*The Central Park NYC Roller Skate Experience\*. This is a collection of soulful house, percussion house, afro house and one disco song which starts with the New York staple track ""Native New Yorker"". Central Park is where skaters go and put their day to day problems aside and let loose with great house music and precise and energetic dance moves on wheels. The organizers of this weekly event wanted the music to be fun and upbeat to match the skaters. The skaters would show up in sequence Broadway outfits that looked like they were straight out of Saturday Night Fever. So if you are ever in NYC in the summer make sure you stop by central park where they block off a street just for skaters and in this mix is the type of music you will here for he most part.

Lately, I've been skating for about 1 hour or less. I'm sore, but it's not unbearable. But I've honestly never really exercised before. So I'm a bit worried I will pull something because of my overexcitement.

2001,feel slow skating outside,Rollerskating,"lately i’ve noticed i feel pretty sluggish skating outside. i have atom pulse wheels (78a 65mm) and rollerbones bearings (not the best quality but they roll well enough and are noticeably better than my old stock bearings) so i don’t really think gear is my problem.

when i first got my outside wheels i remember feeling they were noticeably better than my stock hybrid wheels for outdoors, and i still feel that way but now i feel like i go so slowly. i went ice skating recently at a rink and the next time i got back on my quads outside i felt suuuper slow in comparison, and like i had to work harder. i went on a regular asphalt street and my legs got tired pretty quickly, whereas i ice skated for like an hour and 45 min straight and my legs didn’t get tired the whole time (just some light foot/ankle pain from ill fitting rental skates).

i know inlines (which are more similar to ice skates than quads are) are faster than quads but i almost feel like something’s wrong, like i shouldn’t be going this slowly on quads outside.

do i need to try narrower outdoor wheels? the atom pulses are 37 mm with a 33 mm contact width and i feel like that’s fairly narrow already for an outdoor wheel.

is there anything else i can do to be faster? any advice is welcome!",lately noticed feel pretty sluggish skating outside atom pulse wheel mm rollerbones bearing best quality roll well enough noticeably better old stock bearing really think gear problem first got outside wheel remember feeling noticeably better stock hybrid wheel outdoors still feel way feel like go slowly went ice skating recently rink next time got back quad outside felt suuuper slow comparison like work harder went regular asphalt street leg got tired pretty quickly whereas ice skated like hour min straight leg get tired whole time light foot ankle pain ill fitting rental skate know inlines similar ice skate quad faster quad almost feel like something wrong like going slowly quad outside need try narrower outdoor wheel atom pulse mm mm contact width feel like fairly narrow already outdoor wheel anything else faster advice welcome,"['lately', 'noticed', 'feel', 'pretty', 'sluggish', 'skating', 'outside', 'atom', 'pulse', 'wheel', 'mm', 'rollerbones', 'bearing', 'best', 'quality', 'roll', 'well', 'enough', 'noticeably', 'better', 'old', 'stock', 'bearing', 'really', 'think', 'gear', 'problem', 'first', 'got', 'outside', 'wheel', 'remember', 'feeling', 'noticeably', 'better', 'stock', 'hybrid', 'wheel', 'outdoors', 'still', 'feel', 'way', 'feel', 'like', 'go', 'slowly', 'went', 'ice', 'skating', 'recently', 'rink', 'next', 'time', 'got', 'back', 'quad', 'outside', 'felt', 'suuuper', 'slow', 'comparison', 'like', 'work', 'harder', 'went', 'regular', 'asphalt', 'street', 'leg', 'got', 'tired', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'whereas', 'ice', 'skated', 'like', 'hour', 'min', 'straight', 'leg', 'get', 'tired', 'whole', 'time', 'light', 'foot', 'ankle', 'pain', 'ill', 'fitting', 'rental', 'skate', 'know', 'inlines', 'similar', 'ice', 'skate', 'quad', 'faster', 'quad', 'almost', 'feel', 'like', 'something', 'wrong', 'like', 'going', 'slowly', 'quad', 'outside', 'need', 'try', 'narrower', 'outdoor', 'wheel', 'atom', 'pulse', 'mm', 'mm', 'contact', 'width', 'feel', 'like', 'fairly', 'narrow', 'already', 'outdoor', 'wheel', 'anything', 'else', 'faster', 'advice', 'welcome']",134

2043,help choose next pair skate,Rollerskating,"I'm currently skating on chaya Melrose deluxe, they have been serving me well but are starting to rip from the heel. 
I'm currently in between 3 different skates, similar specs but I'm concerned about the nylon plates on the lollies and the boardwalks. 

I do distance trail skating and a bit of park skating, getting into park a bit more. I won't be able to upgrade for another year at least after this so I am looking for a pair of sturdy boots. If you have any other suggestions please do comment! 

Choice 1: Chuffed skates, they're a new Aussie skate brand but their customer service seem really good and I haven't heard a bad thing about them besides lack of colours or the way the colours show which is not an issue for me. Alloy plates, suede boot. 

Choice 2: Suregrip boardwalks, I've heard great things about these skates and I prefer them over the evokes. Only issue I would have is the nylon plate, I'm not sure if it would be okay park skating with the nylon plates.

Now I spent a bunch of time looking through the OUCH section and while I've learned a lot, I am worried about hurting myself.  My joints and ligaments are really sensitive.  I've sprained my wrist in my sleep this past year because I'm a crazy sleeper.  My feet are all effed up from working barefoot on a hard floor for 8 hours a day.  If I f\*ck up my wrist or ankle, I can't go to work(I work as an infant teacher) and I've already used all my stupid sick and vacation leave quarantining because someone in my childcare center tested positive for co-vid.

The idea of skating makes me so excited.  I have my skates picked out.  I have been scoping out places and smooth surfaced areas and low traffic parking lots to practice in, but this hobby might become a bit too expensive if I get laid up.

2059,restoring vintage roller skate thing consider,Rollerskating,"Hey everyone!

I've been kicking around the idea of restoring some vintage skates. 

Vintage skates are pretty easy to find in decent shape at a good price. But is it worth restoring them?

I know that boot quality is a large part of a skate's overall quality, and I love the boot style of old skates. So as long as I found a pair of skates where the boot was in good shape (or easily cleaned up) I would be good in that regard.

I understand that with vintage skates the plate would be heavier, and probably single action. I don't mind the extra weight personally. Other than that though, how much of a role does the plate have in the overall quality of the skate?

If I just got some nice bearings and good wheels would I be good to go? Are the bearings and wheel the main concern I would need to have some skates that turned and rolled well?

Any advice or things I should be aware of would be great!

2060,softer wheel better learning outdoor setting,Rollerskating,"Hi all! Absolute beginner here. Prior to all the covid shutdowns I had been taking beginner ice skating lessons and I have my own entry-level Riedell skates. Was progressing ok, got as far as backward double and single swizzles. That was back in March. Decided a few weeks ago that roller skating might be worth a try since I have no idea when my local ice rink will reopen to group lessons (I'm in Southern California). So I'm essentially starting from scratch and really struggling. 

I purchased some SFR quads, not the best quality, but not the worst for the price ($80). I know they're pretty much toys and do plan to upgrade in the near future, maybe some Boardwalks. The SFRs have a plastic plate but all other parts are aluminum. Wheels are 82A 58x32, PU cast. I've only done three 30-45 minute sessions on a outdoor hockey rink and a concrete path. I'm able to do a few forward bubbles and some gliding. I don't feel very stable in these. I'm sure it's half the junk skates, half me. I've taken a couple falls, nothing major, but did get a bruised tailbone from one of those falls. I'm a fan of all the protective gear, including padded shorts. 

I should have a little more time to invest starting this week. I'm planning on doing about an hour 2-3x a week, hopefully a little more. I figure until I'm ready to purchase some better skates, it might be worth changing the wheels. I have some Smoothies on the way (78A, 65x38) and I'm hoping these will at least help me get a better footing so that I can develop some basic skills in the mean time.

2067,dozen hour retro music spotify skate playlist,Rollerskating,"\*\* REPOST \*\*

(Here are some playlists to break in those new skates you got for Christmas, or to pep you up for taking down the Christmas decorations 😀)

BACKGROUND  
Wednesday nights at my local rink are ""Retro Music"" nights (70s-80s to current). They use the same playlist almost every week, which gets boring. Since I'm ""of that era"", to try to help them out I compiled a collection of Retro music that I felt would be good to skate to. I gradually built this collection over 2 years. Since each skate session is 2.5 hours long, I created 12 2.5 hour mixes to give them a different playlist (with no duplicates) every week for 3 months--30 hours of music. I have skated through each playlist and found them very skateable.

I shared the collection with the rink manager months ago, but they have not used it. After spending many hours selecting &amp; editing the MP3s and arranging them into playlists, I didn't want the effort to go to waste so I copy the MP3s to flash drives and share them with people who hopefully will enjoy them.

For people who prefer streaming, I created Spotify playlists for each mix to post here on Reddit. These Spotify playlist links are also posted in the r/rollerskating wiki, along with several other user-submitted skating playlist links.

MUSIC DESCRIPTION  
Mostly 70s and 80s, with some older songs from the 50s and 60s, and also some newer songs from the 90s &amp; 2000s. Nothing ""current"", no rap/hip-hop.

Lots of classic rock, disco, pop, and some R&amp;B/Motown. Some acapella covers of hits from that era. 98% up-tempo, strong beat, good to skate to, with a few slower ""couples skate"" songs to catch your breath.

I used ""High Quality"" or ""Remastered"" song versions whenever possible for the best quality.

There are a few duplicates, with the original and a remix/dance version, but always in different playlists.

Each RetroMix contains roughly 40 songs, with diverse songs, artists, and tempos in each mix without repeating artists or music styles consecutively.

The RetroMixes are basically in artist name order, with a few manual adjustments to ensure variety. Each RetroMix can be played as-is with no need to Shuffle.

I hope you enjoy these and look forward to your thoughts &amp; comments.

I created 3 genre-specific Spotify playlists.    
Some of the music is ""nontraditional"" skating music, but is good to skate to if you enjoy those types of music.

2087,wheeler roller skate practical,Rollerskating,"Hi all! I'm completely new to roller skating and have only ever used long boards. I'm thinking of 3D printing my own roller skate with 2 wheels in the front and one in the back to help with balance. The front wheels might have tilting mechanism just as a feature.   


My question to you skaters is: Do you imagine a ""tri-skate"" design to be practical? Or would you find this to be difficult to ride?   


My siblings also want to learn to skate and I just thought maybe this configuration could be helpful for beginners. What I'm uncertain of is the usability of the skate. Would the tilting mechanism (and/or the dual front wheels) get in the way of ""pedaling"" forward? It would be kind of a waste of filament if it turns out to be impractical.

2090,question bearing wheel impala,Rollerskating,"Hi, 

I’m super new to skating (have only been skating since September) and I have a question about the wheels/bearings on Impalas. JSYK: I didn’t learn about the controversy surrounding the brand until after I bought them and they were the only brand available/in my budget at the time - I’m trying to make my Impalas better while saving my money for new skates. 

When I first got them, the factory settings on the wheels were so tight that I could barely move. I skated on them like that for a while before discovering I could loosen them (I didn’t know any better lol). I loosened them and they started to feel better. However, recently, my wheels have started to feel a little too loose (when I set my skates on the ground by themselves,they start rolling in their own - is that supposed to happen?). I’ve tried tightening my wheels but not much has changed. I’ve tightened my wheels all the way and the wheels are still loose. 

Could my bearings be the issue? I haven’t cleaned my bearings yet (I just bought some bearings cleaner and lube online and am waiting for it). Could cleaning them be the solution? Or should I change my bearings altogether?",hi super new skating skating since september question wheel bearing impala jsyk learn controversy surrounding brand bought brand available budget time trying make impala better saving money new skate first got factory setting wheel tight could barely move skated like discovering could loosen know better lol loosened started feel better however recently wheel started feel little loose set skate ground start rolling supposed happen tried tightening wheel much changed tightened wheel way wheel still loose could bearing issue cleaned bearing yet bought bearing cleaner lube online waiting could cleaning solution change bearing altogether,"['hi', 'super', 'new', 'skating', 'skating', 'since', 'september', 'question', 'wheel', 'bearing', 'impala', 'jsyk', 'learn', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'brand', 'bought', 'brand', 'available', 'budget', 'time', 'trying', 'make', 'impala', 'better', 'saving', 'money', 'new', 'skate', 'first', 'got', 'factory', 'setting', 'wheel', 'tight', 'could', 'barely', 'move', 'skated', 'like', 'discovering', 'could', 'loosen', 'know', 'better', 'lol', 'loosened', 'started', 'feel', 'better', 'however', 'recently', 'wheel', 'started', 'feel', 'little', 'loose', 'set', 'skate', 'ground', 'start', 'rolling', 'supposed', 'happen', 'tried', 'tightening', 'wheel', 'much', 'changed', 'tightened', 'wheel', 'way', 'wheel', 'still', 'loose', 'could', 'bearing', 'issue', 'cleaned', 'bearing', 'yet', 'bought', 'bearing', 'cleaner', 'lube', 'online', 'waiting', 'could', 'cleaning', 'solution', 'change', 'bearing', 'altogether']",93

The hole within the core of the bushings seems to be too small. When I try to twist them onto the kingpin, the threads scrape grooves into the hard core of the bushings. I’ve been able to get them to the bottom of the threading but no further. I tried them on my Reactor Pros, too, but to even less success.
I’ve tried warming them up next to a space heater before attempting to force them on. I’m tempted to sand the hole to try to widen them a tiny bit, but don’t know if that would compromise the structural integrity of the bushing. I’ve dealt with cold/tight bushings before, but these seem like they’re simply too narrow for the kingpin.

Has anyone had similar issues? Is brute strength the only way to go here? Please help!

I received my new lollies after a long wait of nearly six months.  In the meantime, I got pretty comfortable on my beach bunnies in mostly stock components - switched out the toe stops and the wheels to fundae.  I even started skating at skate parks in my beach bunnies.  I adore my new lollies and I can tell they are of higher quality, but they are also so reactive! I think it's the softer bushings, the narrower wheel base, and of course the soft suede uppers but I feel a but unstable on them when I felt fierce in my beach bunnies.  There are many things I do love about the lollies over the bunnies and I know it is just a period of adjustment, it just feels so strange to feel shaky when I felt confident the week before on clunkier skates.  But if skating has taught me anything it is that practice and time are everything!

2169,sell keep first skate,Rollerskating,"Hey skaters,

This is kind of random and one of those ""only you can answer this"" kind of question, but I'd really appreciate your thoughts.  I'm wondering how many of you held onto your first skates despite ""outgrowing"" them?  I started on Jackson Finesses and they are great; they have held up well and still look in great condition.  However, now that I've got a pair of Lollies I much prefer the feel of a less stiff/structured boot.  I do not really find myself wanting to skate in my Jacksons.  I've been trying to think through scenarios that might work; i.e. keep them as an indoor skate or trail/cruiser, but I feel like more than likely in those cases I'm going to want to use my Lollies.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'd almost rather get another pair of Lollies, a Jack boot, or some Riedell Zones...and I worry that having three pairs is overkill.  But I don't want to regret parting with the Jacksons.  I'm not that sentimental about them, more just having them because they are a solid skate and are in great condition.  But I also think they would serve another beginner skater well as they still have tons of life left.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts are greatly appreciated!  What would you do in my scenario?  Did anyone regret selling their first pair of skates?

Any STL skaters out there that know of some smooth parking lots/tennis courts/trails in Mid County STL? I'm a beginner and I'm struggling to find some good spots to practice.

I live kind of far from Chesterfield Valley or Creve Couer Lake trails, though I've heard good things! But, anything in Brentwood/Webster/Olivette/Maplewood (again, Mid County) would be ideal.

2341,picking next boot style,Rollerskating,"I currently have impalas that I’ve been skating on since about May. They’re still holding up fine, but I’m starting to look into an upgrade since so many people say they feel a huge difference in their skating once they upgrade and I desperately want to feel that!!

My issue is, idk if I want a heeled vs flat boot or more vs less ankle support because I’ve only ever skated on my impalas. I find that I lace them very tightly when I attempt park skating (I’ve only practiced pumping so I can’t say much yet) and looser when I’m skating any other way. 

I’ve been eying a vans setup but worried about adjusting to little ankle support and a flat heel bc I love to spin and dance. If I go for a heeled boot I’ve been looking at suregrip boardwalks (is that enough of an upgrade to be worth it though??) but I’m short so I’m worried the boot will come up too high on my calf...

Or do I just need to wait until skates are in stock again so I can try different options on?

I'm scared of getting an 8 and it being too small but I'm also scared of getting a 9 where, according to the chart, the measurements already seem kinda big for my feet and have the possibility of them getting even looser once I break them in.

I was dipping my toes back into skating after 20+ years and figured I should go economical first - still a terrible choice) - it’s been difficult keeping up with all of the sites and their discount codes, so I figured maybe someone could halp me out. 

I have started the warranty process with Impala to get replacements.. that can hopefully last until I can snag Lolly’s. 

Also, can anyone explain why the Jade option is $100 more? I keep going between them and a few other colors.. but I see no difference other than color. I could be missing something, this shit has me all bent out of shape. 

Turns out I’m an intermediate skater after all of this time, so I’m ready to drop the $.

2416,got injured skatepark blown away patronizing scooter kid amp skateboarder,Rollerskating,"This is a combo rant / roller skate community appreciation post. 

Went to the skatepark with a new group of skate friends on Sunday, some of whom I hadn’t met before. It was a beautiful day and we got there in the afternoon, so naturally it was full of scooter kids and teenagers on skateboards. 

At one point I decided to practice jumping off the box. I was going really slow to get a feel for the height, and when I tried it faster I... well I’m not sure what happened exactly but suddenly my left foot was facing the wrong way and I was definitely in shock. 

While My friends called an ambulance and tried to keep people away from me, some guy on a skateboard rode up and very loudly said, “WOAH that’s not the way a leg is supposed to go!” Hmm, what gave you that impression?? I told him I didn’t want to hear it and he sounded annoyed at that response 🙄

Just a few minutes later a kid on a scooter came up to me and asked if I was okay. I thought this was nice, so I started to tell him my friends had called an ambulance but he cut me off and said “You just need to learn to control your falls better, okayyy?” 

🙄 x 1 million. 

My skate group was the complete opposite - they found all my stuff, tried to help me stay calm and ignore the assholes, and the person I just met that day told off a teenager for me. 

What is it about scooter kids and teenagers on skateboards that makes them such assholes??? What is it about roller skaters that makes this community so supportive? I have to guess some of it is age (we were definitely the oldest people there by like 10 years) but it’s just baffling to me. 


Btw, it turned out to be a compound tib/fib fracture. I had surgery that night and am now on the (probably long) path to recovery!

My first pair of skates just arrived in the mail, and I am absolutely STOKED to start learning! I've been told that I should have a fun playlist to skate to since it makes the experience even more fun. I really love my 80's pop, and trust me, I've already got that playlist ready to go. However! I'm looking for some other genres to get myself into a certain mood while skating. If you guys have any suggested songs based on the ideas I listed below, I would be forever grateful! 

I am also open to your personal favorites!

**Genres**:

\- electro swing (like Caravan Palace)

\- modern disco?? Is this a thing?

\- hip hop/soul/etc. (Anderson Paak vibes)

\- Funk

&amp;#x200B;

**Moods**:

\- like I'm the main character of a movie

\- dreamy

\- feel good vibes

\- makes you want to dance!

\- Lone Digger by Caravan Palace

\- Get Lucky by Daft Punk

\- Electric U by Kid Bloom

\- Dang! by Mac Miller

I stopped going on my skatestagram and don’t interact with this forum either because going through it just gives me such anxiety and this weird feeling that I can only describe as feeling left behind! I love this community and the people in it, but seeing photos and videos of everyone doing it and being out there just gives me a bad pit in my stomach. I love skating and often think of a time where I’ll feel safe to do it again, but the ways I feel best are doing it with the people I love and meeting new people and that doesn’t feel safe right now to do. My boyfriend says I should just gear up and go out alone, but I feel paralyzed and also that sounds like it would remind me of the friends I’m missing to a point where it would make me feel worse and not better in a way?

2443,coldest skate far f mph wind learned,Rollerskating,"So it actually wasn't too bad!!! I warmed up pretty quick, and even ended up shedding a layer. My wheels felt sluggish... hard to say if it was because i was skating into the wind, if the cold affected them, or if it was actually my body that wasn't moving great. My nose was runny, and my toes did eventually get cold-- par for the course with winter sports i'd say (i snowboard). I'm glad i had my fleece-lined pants on, but if it gets much colder i might just wear skipants lol. I probably would have lasted longer with toe warmers in my boots (i was already wearing thick alpaca socks).   


I ordered some earmuffs to try and wear with my helmet, but today i just went with a thick hat. I'm not sure if that's the best solution-- maybe there's a thin beanie that would fit under my helmet that would keep me warmer. Butt coverage was also key-- once i took off my longer coat my butt got chilly lol.   


All in all: Manageable. Some slight alterations (and perhaps going while the court is still bathed in sun) and i could get a proper session in under these conditions.

So I'm in the market for new skates, I was looking  at the Ridell 135's, a boot which is just to layers of leather, s lining and and outer. I'm really keen on them but I'm just worried I'll find them super  uncomfortable. I know they mold to the foot over time, being  leather, but I just worry  about the lack of 'padding' and stiffness of such a boot. (not sure I'm using the right words) 

For all the things to dislike about Impalas, I did enjoy the like spongy-ness of the boot where as a skates like the 135's dont have that, I'm also super worried about the ankle support, or lack their of such a boot might provide. 

I should mention I'm in Australia, an their are no local stores that have the 135's for me to try on, unless I wanna jump on a plane for 4 hours to get to Perth, (which isn't really in the budget).",skating second pair impala first pair ripped replacement pair ripping well market new skate looking ridell boot layer leather lining outer really keen worried find super uncomfortable know mold foot time leather worry lack padding stiffness boot sure using right word thing dislike impala enjoy like spongy ness boot skate like dont also super worried ankle support lack boot might provide mention australia local store try unless wanna jump plane hour get perth really budget,"['skating', 'second', 'pair', 'impala', 'first', 'pair', 'ripped', 'replacement', 'pair', 'ripping', 'well', 'market', 'new', 'skate', 'looking', 'ridell', 'boot', 'layer', 'leather', 'lining', 'outer', 'really', 'keen', 'worried', 'find', 'super', 'uncomfortable', 'know', 'mold', 'foot', 'time', 'leather', 'worry', 'lack', 'padding', 'stiffness', 'boot', 'sure', 'using', 'right', 'word', 'thing', 'dislike', 'impala', 'enjoy', 'like', 'spongy', 'ness', 'boot', 'skate', 'like', 'dont', 'also', 'super', 'worried', 'ankle', 'support', 'lack', 'boot', 'might', 'provide', 'mention', 'australia', 'local', 'store', 'try', 'unless', 'wanna', 'jump', 'plane', 'hour', 'get', 'perth', 'really', 'budget']",75
2493,first day skate,Rollerskating,"This is more of a rant than asking for questions, I guess. I watched so many videos the past two days and I just thought ""screw it"". I woke up this morning, put on my pads and the skates I bought 2 years ago before forgetting about because I was too scared to even try, and tried to stand in them. 

I managed to lift off of my sofa, okay get my posture right, and I still roll forward until I fall. Okay, that's expected, let's try standing on the rug so I can focus on my posture a bit more. I think I've got it, back onto the hardwood floor, and immediately roll until I fall. I can't figure out how to stop myself rolling, my feet are in a V and I'm low, my thighs are starting to burn, but I'm low and I'm still rolling and falling.

I see that generally wheels designed for park skating range from 55-61ish mm in diameter. 

How might the wheel diameter affect things such as speed, agility, etc., while skating. Are certain sizes better for street vs vert?

Asphalt is a beast like no other I’ve met. I never knew that a sidewalk crack could scare me so much. You really start to realize how little people use their turn signals. And of course, there was a 3 year old’s birthday party going on so lots of people at the park. 

Eventually I found spot on the road just outside the corner of the park that wasn’t quite asphalt, I’m assuming it just smoother cement. I got into a little groove and unknowingly skated for more that two hours! It was so much fun!!

2549,venting skate shipping story,Rollerskating,"I purchased a pair of skates on Black Friday. A website was having a Black Friday sale and had a discount code to add to the already marked down stuff. The skates I wanted were cheaper than retail price so I decided to get them. All goes well they ship pretty fast, they get delivered and they was the wrong size. I ordered a size 6 and I got a size 5 I tried them on but I knew they wouldn’t fit. So I emailed them and told them what happened, I sent the skates back. They tell me they would send the right size right away. But I looked on their website and that size is sold out. 

So the skates I sent back get delivered and I still haven’t got a tracking update for the correct size skates. I emailed them I'm told they had to ship directly from the company who made the skates. They give me a new tracking number I check it and being ship to the wrong state. I email again stating this issue asking if they sent me the wrong tracking and I get “ill look into it”.

2629,speed skate roller dancing,Rollerskating,"Hey all! I am a complete newbie and I’m looking for a little advice! 

I’ve been thinking about picking up skating as a hobby for the last few months. The roller rink in town went out of business, so I got some skates in my size for $10!! Perfect for me to try it out and see if it’s something I like. 

The skates they had left are speed skates, so I snagged a pair. I am wondering if these will be okay to start on? Are speed skates harder to maneuver? 

If I can find my balance and flow, I’m hoping to get into some skate dancing. Will I be able to learn basic moves on these speed skates? I have noticed that the wheels are pretty wide. 

Looking for any input and advice that you all have!

2632,think sure grip boardwalk knock offs,Rollerskating,"Is that even a thing? Through some research on this sub, and from friends and my wife who roller derby, I was told Sure-Grip was a reputable brand. I paid $240 for my first pair of rollerskates - some Sure-Grip Boardwalks. The day they came, they came in a white box... hrm. ok, maybe they just don't want people stealing them off porches.... I would have liked to have a Sure-Grip box but whatever... Inside there was very little Sure-Grip branded packaging. A white sheet (super thin like gift bag staffing) with Sure-Grip logo pattern, a ""Sure-Grip"" warranty that looked like it was designed by a 12 year old, and a ""Quality Assurance"" sheet that was not signed or dated. Strange...

The wheels and bearings are just... meh. And something just seems ""off"" about them when I look at the Boardwalks on the Sure-Grip website. Of course, on the website they have an aluminum plate - mine is ""Rock Nylon"" but it straight up looks and feels like plastic... Anyways... Here's what I purchased:

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XT6HMJL/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o00\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XT6HMJL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

I've taken them out twice now, outdoors, and these are indoor skates. So Perhaps that's part of my issue. But the packaging and nylon plate quality (and bearings quality) are just throwing me off, hard.

2656,new line skater question,Rollerskating,"I bought in-line skates on cyber Monday, and I have ridden them for 30-40 mins at a time every evening for the past four days. I fell twice, but I have not fallen during the last two sessions. 

**Situation &amp; Goals**

I practice in an outdoor basketball court. I walk to the court in regular shoes, change to skates and then change back to go home. There is a hill on the way home and cracked residential pavement. I would like to transition to skating on the road, if that is advisable. There is a nice trail within driving distance, and I would like to graduate there at some point. I am just doing this for fun, exercise and fresh air. I am not interested in competitions or tricks.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**

Feel free to answer any of these questions!

1 - How do you practice stopping in the L form?

2 - What are other drills you would recommend? 

3 - How long should I wait before going on ""regular residential road"" pavement that is quite cracked?

4 - Are any of the drills I discuss below bad ideas?

5 - Anything else you would tell a new in-line skater? I have been watching various Youtube videos.

 

**Things I Am Good At**

\&gt; turning (both ways)

\&gt; pushing/gliding

\&gt; squatting really low while rolling

\&gt; bending knees and keeping my hands up in general

\&gt; (getting better at) balancing on one foot at a time

\&gt; having fun during each session and looking forward to it during the day

&amp;#x200B;

**I would like to learn** how to use my stopper/brake, how to do the L stop, how to go downhill safely, etc. It would also be nice to not feel so rusty every time I start going. After I warm up, I am good to go, but I feel so rusty at the beginning of each session, despite being out there just 24 hours earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

**Drills I Created &amp; Do Every Session**

\&gt; throw a small tree nut out in front of me a reasonable distance, skate normally halfway to where it lands, squat really low and roll for the second half, and then grab it with one hand. Repeat several times.

\&gt; lightly hold the basketball hoop pole and balance on one foot for approx. 30 seconds in my normal skating stance (knees bent, eyes forward, hands up). Switch feet and repeat several times. Alternate between holding the non-used leg still and moving it in circles.

\&gt; hold the fence for balance and do muscle memory of pulling my back leg behind me for the L stop form. Started this one today.

I like the idea of wide trucks providing more stability for aggressive park skating and jumps, but I’m concerned about them hindering my ability to do things like spins, dips, strut walk, etc. Does anyone have experience with these?

Or, do you have any other skate suggestions?

2688,get smell wheel,Rollerskating,"So uh long story short I stepped in dog poop yesterday coming up my lawn (thanks neighbor who never picks up after her dog 🖕)

It only got on my wheels (maybe a little on the heel of my skate and my toe stop), but thankfully it didn’t get on the suede so now issues of it staining my few week old skates. I cleaned it off as best as I could, and thankfully my bearings didn’t rust from my frantic towel bath I gave my wheels. The only problem now is they smell still like dog poop. It was mainly just the back right wheel on my right skate, the rest of the wheels seemed to get very little to not poop on them thankfully. But that one wheel stinks. It’s not like “notice it while wearing the skates” bad, but if you sniff the wheel itself it smells. I’ve been keeping my skates in the garage simply because I didn’t want the possibility of smelling it or the smell getting on my carpet.

Im not a “newbie” per se, but my skating skills consist of going around the rink forward, and a little bit backward and thats about it.

Ive owned speed skates when i worked at Sonic (Skating Carhop) and taught myself how to transition from forward to backward and back that way.

With all that backstory out of the way, im getting back into skating and i am getting really sick of rental skates (last friday i went and i swear my front right wheel on my right skate was iffy somehow but Idk what is was)

So im looking at skates to buy and i don’t know what to get.

I dont *think* i want artistic skates because i really liked my outdoor speed skates so im looking at jam skates even though i cant do that.

Jam skating looks cool but i think rhythm skating is more my style (movement and vibing versus breakdancing in one spot)

Can i buy jam skates (VNLA Juniors for example) and learn rhythm skating? Or do i have to buy skates made with rhythm skating in mind?

Are there low cut rhythm skates? I don’t really care about ankle support so i want to avoid boots (unless I should care? Is it important?)

2749,lighting skate without light wheel,Rollerskating,There was a time when i really wanted luminous wheels. But I heard they roll weird and I like my wheels to roll normally! Also new wheels + new bearings + the inconvenience  of having to change out wheels for a night skate = too much $$ and work. This led me down a new path- trying to light up my skates without getting new wheels. I found some lights (board blazers) that are supposed to be glued to the bottom of a skateboard or skates but they have some big design flaws. I found some cool light-up laces that probably aren’t great as laces but could be wrapped around the ankle perhaps. Or maybe some kids’ light up bracelets used in the same way. Have you tried any light-up non-wheel doo-dads on your skates? How did it go?,time really wanted luminous wheel heard roll weird like wheel roll normally also new wheel new bearing inconvenience change wheel night skate much work led new path trying light skate without getting new wheel found light board blazer supposed glued bottom skateboard skate big design flaw found cool light lace probably great lace could wrapped around ankle perhaps maybe kid light bracelet used way tried light non wheel doo dad skate go,"['time', 'really', 'wanted', 'luminous', 'wheel', 'heard', 'roll', 'weird', 'like', 'wheel', 'roll', 'normally', 'also', 'new', 'wheel', 'new', 'bearing', 'inconvenience', 'change', 'wheel', 'night', 'skate', 'much', 'work', 'led', 'new', 'path', 'trying', 'light', 'skate', 'without', 'getting', 'new', 'wheel', 'found', 'light', 'board', 'blazer', 'supposed', 'glued', 'bottom', 'skateboard', 'skate', 'big', 'design', 'flaw', 'found', 'cool', 'light', 'lace', 'probably', 'great', 'lace', 'could', 'wrapped', 'around', 'ankle', 'perhaps', 'maybe', 'kid', 'light', 'bracelet', 'used', 'way', 'tried', 'light', 'non', 'wheel', 'doo', 'dad', 'skate', 'go']",72

2756,feeling discouraged frustrated,Rollerskating,"Hi r/rollerskating, (please kindly excuse any spelling, grammar, or formatting issues, I am on mobile) Sorry in advance for the long post! 

TLDR, my feet hurt and I've tried many things to fix them with no avail. 

As the title suggests, I am feeling quite discouraged and frustrated in my roller skating. I started skating about 2.5 months ago and fell mostly in love. However, I am having pain in my feet when I skate. I have had a phone conversation with my doctor about this and she suggested that the pain I am feeling is Plantar Fasciitis. When I skate, I feel a horrid burning cramp in the arches of my feet. I particularly feel this pain in my right foot, but sometimes I also feel it in my left. 

Some background: 
About 2.5 years ago, I had a benign ganglion cyst removed from the top of my right foot. I had this cyst for about two years before I decided that I wanted it removed. It started small and grew as time went on. I believe I acquired this cyst because of the tendonitis I experienced while working a job the required me to be on my feet for 10-12 hours a day. The cyst was in an unusual location, the very top center of my foot. Recovery from the surgery took several weeks. And now that the first cyst is gone, I have had another pop up right near the site of the original. So far it doesn't seem to bother me. My doctor says that it shouldn't affect the plantar fasciitis. I'm not totally on board with that, but I'm not eliminating it. 

So, when I decided I wanted to try roller skating, I bought a pair of Impalas. I figured they were inexpensive enough that I could try out roller skating and if I didn't like it I wasn't out too much money. I started skating around my house and little by little I gained more confidence. I can't remember exactly when I started feeling the pain in my foot but, it was pretty soon after I started. 

Initially I found that my skates were not wide enough for my feet. So I played around with different lacing patterns and found some that worked for me. My left foot felt fine, so I laced that foot normally and laced my right foot with a different pattern to accommodate my wider foot. Also tried putting in my everyday insoles (super feet in blue, I think?) And that made the pain worse. So I took them out. 

At this point I am skating 3-5 days a week for 10-30 min at a time. I am doing a light warm up beforehand and stretching before I even put my skates on. This helps a bit, but I'm still not able to consecutively skate for more than a few minutes before the pain becomes unbearable and I have to get down on knees to rest. I also adjust my trucks, get outdoor wheels, new cushions, etc. Very minimal changes to my foot pain with each adjustment. 

I eventually decide that my skates just don't fit my right. I think they are too big. Even with all my adjustments my toes are sliding around and there are no more adjustments I can make. So, I buy new skates. 

This time, I go to a brick and mortar store. I explained to the lady helping me about my foot pain. She listened but I can't say she totally understood my problem (I can't fault her too much, maybe this is an uncommon issue).  I tried on several skates. I tried beach bunnies, sure grip board walks, and something else I can't remember. Well, the beach bunnies were awful. The sure grips were ok. But with each skate, my foot hurt just sitting there, I wasn't even standing. I ended up deciding on a pair of Jackson Vantage's. They are a derby style boot. 

With these new skates they have the ability to be heat moulded. So, I have heat moulded these skates to the manufacturer requirements, used a different lacing pattern on my troublesome right foot, and have added my daily insoles to them. The insoles this time around work in these skates, they did not work in my old skates. I am doing a decent warm up before I skate, I thoroughly stretch with a focus on my calves, and I use a tennis ball to roll the sole of my feet out all before I even put my skates on. After I'm done skating I do a pretty vigorous stretching routine with foam rolling. I have also adjusted trucks, put on outdoor wheels, new cushions, etc. I can skate for ~5-10 min before the pain is too much and I have to get down on my knees to rest. Every new move is painful, bubbles, transitions, manuals, etc. Striding is the least painful and I can do it for the longest. But only for maybe 10-12 minutes. 

I can't say that I love the new skates. I think that I don't like the low top boot. I find that my heel isn't super secure. It moves up and down while doing most anything. If I tightened my laces more my heel would shift less but when my laces are super tight it like cuts off the circulation to my feet which causes pain. 

I never feel this pain otherwise. Not while hiking, walking, riding a bike, driving a manual transmission car, etc. I wear supportive insoles in my shoes. I wear shoes while I am cooking, cleaning, or whenever I spend a lot of time on my feet. I stretch my feet frequently, pointing my toes, contracting them, spreading them, etc. I stretch fairly regularly. I try my best to drink a fair amount of water and eat with my health in mind. I am 25F, 5 foot 1in, and weigh about 180lbs, if that matters. I am overweight but I eat decent, excersise fairly regularly, and feel generally healthy. 

The pain is hardly subsiding despite my efforts. I am at a loss. I haven't skated in almost two weeks. I will admit I am a person who gives up easily, but I have given this sport a good effort, more so than most other things I have tried in my life. But my pain persists. I want so badly to be able to do this. I truly enjoy it and desperately want to be able to do it. My goal is to be able to skate outdoors with confidence and maybe a couple of dance moves here and there. Eventually park skating, if I can ever even get to that point. 

So, what should I do? Has anyone else experienced this? 
Will my pain ever subside? Will it ever be tolerable? Should I try switching to roller blades?

One of the plates was visibly crooked and a seam was clearly open between the suede and the heel. In trying to return/get a refund I've been handed off to several different people, none of who seem to be able to actually read my questions and answer them. 

First they said I could get a refund, then after I'd shipped them out to Moxi I got another email saying I didn't qualify for a refund because I didn't reach out in 30 days and that they would see if the manufacturer covered it under their warrenty. Email receipts show it had been under 30 days and when I pointed this out I got another ""oh yes we understand it's frustrating we'll reach out after we receive your skates""

How has your experience been with Moxi's customer service lately? Especially if you've had an issue like this. I went with them originally because they're 'actual skaters on staff' and I didn't want to be dealing with a corporation style customer service team, but that's how it's been so far :/ I'd like to not write them off as a brand that I don't want to support but this has been an extremely disappointing experience.",finally received moxi shy month waiting one plate visibly crooked seam clearly open suede heel trying return get refund handed several different people none seem able actually read question answer first said could get refund shipped moxi got another email saying qualify refund reach day would see manufacturer covered warrenty email receipt show day pointed got another oh yes understand frustrating reach receive skate experience moxi customer service lately especially issue like went originally actual skater staff want dealing corporation style customer service team far like write brand want support extremely disappointing experience,"['finally', 'received', 'moxi', 'shy', 'month', 'waiting', 'one', 'plate', 'visibly', 'crooked', 'seam', 'clearly', 'open', 'suede', 'heel', 'trying', 'return', 'get', 'refund', 'handed', 'several', 'different', 'people', 'none', 'seem', 'able', 'actually', 'read', 'question', 'answer', 'first', 'said', 'could', 'get', 'refund', 'shipped', 'moxi', 'got', 'another', 'email', 'saying', 'qualify', 'refund', 'reach', 'day', 'would', 'see', 'manufacturer', 'covered', 'warrenty', 'email', 'receipt', 'show', 'day', 'pointed', 'got', 'another', 'oh', 'yes', 'understand', 'frustrating', 'reach', 'receive', 'skate', 'experience', 'moxi', 'customer', 'service', 'lately', 'especially', 'issue', 'like', 'went', 'originally', 'actual', 'skater', 'staff', 'want', 'dealing', 'corporation', 'style', 'customer', 'service', 'team', 'far', 'like', 'write', 'brand', 'want', 'support', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'experience']",93

I’m a newbie and finally I’m getting comfortable in my skates. Unfortunately it seems that at around the 30-40 minute mark in my practice sessions I start getting a pretty awful pain in my outer calves. Not my shins, not my actual calf muscles but the outer or oblique sides of both my lower legs. 
I’ve already loosened my trucks. So I don’t think it’s that. For reference I’m skating on black impalas with moxi gummy wheels and rollerbones bearings. I also have a pair of beach bunnies and I experience the same pain. 
Is it just that I haven’t built up the muscle yet? Should I be stretching more? Did anyone else have the same issue, and if so what did you do to get through it?

2837,nausea skating bricked pavement,Rollerskating,"cw emetophobia / vomit

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if it's the bone rattling, my anxiety, general lack of fitness (though she *is* improving woohoo), possibly medication or a combination of all of the above – to skate on the pathways between my (once again shut) skate spot there's a lot of uneven brick paving, mostly due to tree roots from below. it ranges from uneven to full on loose brick and if i lose momentum it becomes a minefield, so I have to keep going. i'll then stop at the traffic light (at which there are cheese graters covering the length of the path in front, also a nightmare) and feel a wave of nausea come on (there's also a 4 way intersection and construction around so bits of gravel may be strewn around the roads)

The first time this happened i'd had a beer an hour prior so that made sense, the second time was post all nighter having had a 500ml thing of soymilk (and actually chundering it up). most recently i noticed it after a decent skate session where I wasn't Toooo stressed or anything (though I did briefly encounter uneven asphalt = under left leg bumpy as hell under right leg super smooth, while trying to skate across the road rather than my usual toe stop hobble

I almost always wear the smallest socks possible in my lollys but need some of those skater socks for the boardwalks. I also don’t like the fabric lining the tongue on the boardwalks. Most forums said they are similar but I found quite a few differences in the two. Both are beautiful skates though and I’m sure the boardwalks will be just fine for trails. 

Who is liking their boardwalks after breaking them in? How does the plate hold up?

2868,german luna skate review,Rollerskating,"  

Hi I've had my Lunas for about a bit longer than half a year as my first skates and wanted to share my experience with you. I'm not a professional skater but I've been using my Lunas around once or twice a week for recreational skating, a little dancing, and a wee little park skating since I got them.

(I feel this “review” is all over the place and English is not my first language so forgive me please)

https://preview.redd.it/5vhagd4rz4361.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d22f6eba10510fd074cedfe5e5d180b754cd212

I have the Pink Lunas they are a little cheaper than the other models. When I asked the shop about the differences, they just told me that all models would be improved by this December but didn’t really answer my question. Luckily a friend of mine bought the more expensive black version around the same time so I’ll be able to compare them a little bit.

https://preview.redd.it/7o9ewnge05361.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=986310cff1fc888670e332bcb37c91ff0466aec5

The only major difference I have noticed so far was that the padding in my skates was thinner especially on the tongue of my boot. Hers did have more padding and the seams seemed to be a bit stronger at first because mine seemed to come undone at the top of the tongue but later I noticed that the tongue was just not sewn up correctly ( I’ll include pictures)

The Boot in general is very soft and comfortable right from the start. No break in period required. I bought mine one size too large in a European 38 ( a UK 5) but I put some insoles into them and it was okay. I still had a lot of room in the front but wasn’t sliding around much.

My skates where already adjusted and ready to roll when they arrived, my friends where not so we had to order a tool to adjust them. No big deal since having a tool for adjustment around is always a good idea. Still her first roll on the skates was not as smooth because of it. 

One thing I have noticed after about three months the glue seam on one my skates came off a little bit on the heel, so the boot separated from the heel a little if that makes sense. My friend with the more expensive skate did not have this problem but she did not skate as much in her Lunas. So, I’m not sure if this difference is there because the cheaper skate is lower quality or because I skated a lot in mine and she didn’t. After another three months the same happened on my other skate.

Maybe someone can let me know if that is a common thing with skates or not?

https://preview.redd.it/gev8xwu205361.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b06714c14a81defe2cbf0e690ec57d2106aa4d50

I don’t think my Luna has much ankle support it is softer and more flexible. When I tried on a friend’s Impalas I noticed how much harder the boot was compared to my skates.

In general, I was and still am very happy with the luna skates since I think they are quite affordable and offer a fun and fancy skate. I can’t say anything bad about the bearings, rolls, toestops and everything but then again, I’m not a pro and they seem just fine to me.

Now here’s the reason why I might switch to a moxi in the not so distant future. 

My skates are too large and I want to get skates that really fit. The Luna Brand only offers the cheaper skates in size 37 ( UK 4). When I asked the brand in October whether they’d release the more expensive version in a size 37 I was told that in November they would. Surprise they did not they just told me that all skates would come in a better quality in December. In December they did release beautiful new skates and stocked up on the older models as well but none of them came in size 37 (I have to admit I’m still a bit bummed out about it and a little salty). Now they’re saying the black skate will be released in January as a size 37 but at this point, I just don’t believe them anymore and I’m thinking about saving up longer and getting the moxi panther or lolly.

## 1. Types of roller skates

There are two primary types of roller skates available in the market, inline roller skates and quad wheel roller skates. Usually, people call quad wheel skates as roller skates.

### 1.1.Quad roller skates

https://preview.redd.it/bo3ff9q394361.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=233ba35d23579c7b3b4167c490bb68952d740b50

Quad roller skates are four-wheeled roller skates with two wheels in front and two in each skate's back. Quad roller skate traditionally features a rubber break, or toe stop, in the show that makes for a comfortable, quick visit. Quad roller skates are preferred by both beginner and advanced roller skaters alike. It requires too little training and experience.

Quad skates might seem a beginner thing but who loves this classical skating version also knows that you get a wide range of outdoor quad skates and indoor quad skates for several types of tasks.  

You can also witness speed skating with quad speed skates and shuffling experience with men's quad skates for break dancing.

### 1.2. Inline roller skates

https://preview.redd.it/1rysj2v594361.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56714e848c7ac2db531677a72c248d6f049894ab

Inline skates have two to five wheels that are arranged in a single line. Especially those for recreation that have a rubber “stop” or “brake” block that is attached to the rear of one or occasionally or both of the skates so that skater can slow down or stop by leaning back on foot with the brake skate.

Now it’s time to learn about types of roller skating.

## 2. Types of roller skating

First, we need to know how many types of roller skating so that we can practice with a perfect pair of a roller skates.

### 2.1. Artistic Roller skating

Artistic Roller Skating is a sport in which competitors wear roller skates instead of not wearing ice skates.  

### 2.2. Figures Roller skating

It has a movement that is symmetrically composed of at least two circles, but not more than three rings, involving primary or primary and secondary activities with or without turns. Figures are skated on rings, which have been inscribed on the skating surface.

### 2.3. Jam Skating

Sounds like Jamming, dancing, or music? It is another popular type of roller skating which is used for dance performances.

Solo dance; It has solo dance as a competition that starts with a tiny lot and goes up to gold.

### 2.4. Freestyle Roller skating

Freestyle roller dancing is a type of style that comes from physical movement and is usually done in music, which is not choreographed or planned ahead of time. This kind of dance can never be the same from performance to performance, although it can be done formally and informally.

### 2.5. Speed Roller skating

[Different roller skating here corresponds to different types of roller skates, that is, different types of quad skates, please click here to view.](https://skatesfun.com/blogs/news/5-different-types-of-quad-skates-that-you-must-know-in-2020)

Let’s start and see what we need to begin practice.

## 3. Pick the right size and style of roller skate

Choosing the right size and style is an essential part of the training. The roller skate industry is continuously launching many types of roller skates. It is better to select the perfect size of roller skate to practice. For this purpose, you can ask your local store salesperson or order online from a reliable store.

## 4. Always use protective gear

https://preview.redd.it/i79spgn794361.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db0b0d13c68f993f2325d3db3601ceaf06f5b150

Having the right protective gear helps you to avoid injuries and support the body. Experts always recommend to put on protective equipment. You must have a helmet, elbow pads, wrist guard, knee pads and, a right size pair of roller skates. Always wear proper safety equipment to protect yourself.

## 5. How to practice rollerskating

Finally, you get accessories and a pair of roller skates according to your desire. Now it time to glide smoothly and rock on the streets and trails. Get up and put on roller skates with protective gear. It’s better to practice on an empty, dry, soft, and flat surface first.

### 5.1. Standing and balancing on a rollerskate

https://preview.redd.it/y9fj25w894361.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7ac844ff88c5ce4f65def2e1bb84aeb7f9e49ab

The first and foremost step is standing and balancing on roller skates, but this is a game of balancing the body on the wheels.

Stand near a wall, or you can take help from a friend. You have to separate your feet and make a V-position. For this purpose, apart your feet about four to six inches and stand straight. It's better to have your arm in front of you and knees bent, so you will not fall.

The wheels under roller skates will remain intact the overall balance of your body. At this stage, don't stand straight and keep balancing on wheels. Try to balance your body on wheels and do the practice of standing and balancing.

### 5.2. Maintain the body posture

For standing and balancing, you need to maintain body posture. A proper posture makes you more comfortable. For perfect balance, try to remain knees bent and use hands to balance the body. Always look straight in front of you and keep your head up.

While practicing, lean your body a bit, bent forward from your waist. The arms help you to maintain balance.

Practice, practice, and practice make you perfect. Be attentive and alert all time and look for obstacles in front of you.

### 5.3. Try to walk with rollerskates

It's a game of balancing body weight on the roller skates. However, when you start walking on roller skates, you think you might slip and fall anytime. Be in control and don't think about falling on the ground. Walking on roller skates may feel like you are moonwalking, but it is easier than you think. Think of a toddler who is trying to take the first step.

A beginner skater must understand to use both hands for balance. Take a deep breath and start small steps for basic stride, balance body weight evenly to the extent that it won't cause you to slip, and take one step at a time. To avoid unbalancing, don't take more steps quickly.

### 5.4. Start rollerskating slowly

https://preview.redd.it/v9i5jsca94361.jpg?width=930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d2836e91f7d9df3383c6abe020083e5b3fd620f

After practice walking with your roller skates, start gliding but slowly. For this purpose, push one foot forward and keep gliding. The technique is to put your foot forward, then shift body weight to other foot.

Rehearse the roller-skating technique and focus on your balance for each leg.  Try to learn where it feels comfortable and do some practice, but slowly until you feel comfortable.

Practice until you consciously balance yourself.

### 5.5. Keep a balance between legs

It would be best if you focused on the balance between legs. Simultaneously, skating raises one foot forward and pushes away with the other foot before unbalancing. Meanwhile, shift the weight from your back foot to your front foot. You definitely feel that your feet are moving apart. Try to maintain the balance between the feet. Retrieve feet in close and make V-position to skate smoothly

### 5.6. Keep practicing

Finally, you learn how to balance the body and glide. It’s time for practice. Practice until you are comfortable with roller skates.

Now you can learn more techniques, but remember every trick needs time and practice for perfection.

### 5.7. Learn Turning and stopping

While you are fluent in roller skating, it is important to learn how to stop. While you find an obstacle, slow your speed, or it is better to stop. It's better to use brakes instead of crashing into someone to avoid injury. Roller skates have brake pads; for using them just push the toe of the skate and stop.

Also, it is recommended that you slow your speed first before using the brakes. If you use the brake pads at high speed, they can get damaged.

 You need to learn at least one way to stop when you feel uncomfortable or in a dangerous situation. However, high-end roller skates have brake pads, but some inline skates don't have them. In this situation, use these techniques.

* Use your knee pad to stop
* Perfect the spinout stop
* Using the T-stop

### 5.8. Enhance your skill

It's better to enhance your roller skating skill gradually. You can observe other skaters or take help from the internet to learn different techniques.

### 5.9. Practice at proper surface

 Practise makes you more perfect, so it's better to practice in a skate park or rink. Where you can observe other skater's performance as well, practice at the proper surface makes you more comfortable and you will able to learn more advanced techniques.

### 5.10. Join a team or skate group

It's fun to learn to roller skate on your own, but if you're up for a challenge, consider joining a team or skate group. There are many roller skating activities like Roller derby and roller hockey that will help you to improve your skating ability. Thus challenge yourself and join a team.

## 6. Tips for practice roller skating

It's essential to know some tips that help you while you are practicing.

* You must know the use of brakes and when face an obstacle must use them.
* To avoid serious injuries, learn the right way to fall. Whenever you lose your balance, bend a little, and use your hands to stable.

2875,chaya toe stop trouble,Rollerskating,"I got some chaya Melrose deluxe skates, first time I took out the toe stops to put some guards on I discovered one of the bolts was so tight that the screw got worn out. Was a challenge to get it out but obviously couldn't use the same screw again. 

It is a bolt on toe stop but it doesn't seem to be standard. The closest I've been able to find is a 5/16"" 1 inch bolt but it seems like the chaya bolts are just a bit longer (by barely 1/4"") and a tiny bit thinner than those. There's no other match and I have been really frustrated as other bolts that skate shops here sell don't fit (powerdyne, pilot etc) and I can't find any matches at any hardware stores. 

The skateshops have been unhelpful so far and telling me I have to buy new toe stops with the bolts but like, will they fit? Chaya don't sell those specific bolt on toe stops and I'm super confused. 

Anyone else found a solution to this issue?

At this point my biggest reason for sticking with the preorder was the fact that I already bought accessories for the Emerald City (and I've been dying to get dark green skayes) but that seems like a dumb reason with all these negative reviews. I made my order with Pigeon's so I was thinking of replacing my preorder with one of their in stock skates, which include the Sure Grip Blue Dream and Chaya Love is Love.

2893,rude practice along wall,Rollerskating,"Hi! In my neighborhood, one of the baskteball courts at the park is a super popular spot to skate. I'm a beginner (just got my skates last week) and so far I've been going there to skate. I'm the only beginner I've seen there, most people are pretty experienced compared to me. I'm still having some balance issues and so I usually start off skating back and forth close to the wall for a bit, because it takes me a while to get used to skating each time. I was just wondering if this is bad etiquette?

I'm pretty set on  a tan suede boot, I'd love the moxie  lollies in yellow, but I have super flat feet that roll in, and I think the lack of a leather lining will mean the boots is just too floppy for me. And the Jack boot is just a little more than I'd like to spend just yet, might have to wait a few years. 

So yeah I was keen on either the Riedell 135 boot. [https://usaskates.com/riedell-135-zone-boot/](https://usaskates.com/riedell-135-zone-boot/)

After getting comfortable with those, I decided I was ready to drop into to a section that had a metal coping. I tried getting low and reaching forward with my hands for balance, but BOOM! My feet slipped out from under me and I ended up landing on my tailbone. I got the wind knocked out of me and couldn't do anything but roll over and just wheeze for a couple seconds. Eventually I got back up and I don't think I broke anything, so I skated around a bit more, just getting a feel for those banks and the ground transitioning under my feet. I wanted to try again, but I didn't think my bum could handle another hit like that. 

Anyways it's been several hours since and I've been gingerly moving around my house, tucking a bag of frozen veg in my pants against my tailbone, but all I can think about is going out and trying it again. Is there any advice that can help me drop in? Should I be reaching my hands out in front or do you think reaching down towards my feet will help me stay forward instead of falling back?

2976,radar energy wheel v sims street snake also stuff wheel diameter lip shape,Rollerskating,"I initially wanted the white Clouds Nucleus wheels (62 x 37mm) but they're sold out everywhere. I've been offered the Sims Street Snakes instead which are the same dimensions but I'm not too impressed by them... I know looks aren't the most important thing, but I wanted something more stylish and modern looking. They have the Radar Energy wheels in 62 x 32 and 57 x 32, different diameters but slightly narrower than the Nucleus and Sims either way. I prefer the 57mm colour. What do people think of the Sims vs the Radar? What difference will the slightly smaller diameter make to me? I'm 5 ft 8 and heavy, approaching 300lbs. They're all 78A.

3014,baby skater skate wheel slippery wheel jiggle axle,Rollerskating,"Hi so im new to the group and kinda new to skating but basically here's my issue.

So back in 2018 i bought a pair of rio rollers as i wanted to learn how to skate mostly outdoors just recreationally, but i got busy and ended up not skating for about a year. I got back into skating around 2020 and didn't know much about indoor/outdoor wheels so was using my rio roller wheels which were  82A / 58mm wheels to skate over asphalt like in an under bridge car park area. Which was fine and i personally didn't find an issue skating over it with them on.  Eventually i found another place to practice after a couple weeks skated there for a a few weeks but i eventually noticed my wheels were very slippery. 

Like the floor felt super slick and I was always felt like i was i was going to fall backwards no matter whether i was skating, standing or just sitting. It almost felt like i was skating on ice and even if i put my skates on flat ground they would like roll away (i don't know if this normal or anything). So i ended up putting them away for a while until i could change wheels then the pandemic happened. So fast forward to now, i got new pulse atom wheels that are 78a / 65mm changed them out and everything and i thought it would help but im noticing the exact same thing, the floor feels so slick and I feel like im gonna slip backwards 24/7. It's an improvement on before but still I'm noticing the same type of thing. Also as a note i didn't change the bearings but I'm planning to probably go with the roller bones or super reds. 

So I don't know if it's a wheel thing or a me thing, would tightening the axle nuts do anything at all or like going softer or harder? (i don't know that much atm).

 Also i notice they move on the axles  so like you can slightly jiggle the wheels and was wondering what could be done to fix that (I'll attach photos and videos) because when i tighten the axle nut to the point it doesn't jiggle anymore its too tight for the wheels to even spin.

3018,riedell moxi panther inside rink skating,Rollerskating,"Hi there. I currently have lollies for mooching around outside and rios for inside that have had good use out of them for a few years. I want to treat myself to some new inside skates,like forever skates really I'm not about buying new every few years. Now I'm never going to be doing any amazing tricks or anything but I want some skates with good ankle support (Old injury) for my skate lessons. I love the suede of my lollies but the ankle support isn't there. If I get panthers £230 I would need to buy inside wheels, whereas the riedells I've found being sold are the same price but an indoor set up. And leather.  As I have narrow feet I was thinking the leather would form better to my feet, and I know panthers are known as being narrower than say boardwalks, hence my list narrowed down to these options.

Also, is it true the black riedell  are wider than the white, the website I've seen says they are both available in medium width.

Opinions please!

3041,sure grip fame wheel used park skating,Rollerskating,"i know the sure grip fame wheels are marketed as ""artistic"" wheels, but they seem basically the same as ""park"" wheels to me - hard (95a), small-ish (57x30 mm), and don't look too ""square"" on the edges. same for the sure grip royal artistic wheels or the rollerbones team wheels - they seem kinda generic.

is there any particular reason they wouldn't be good for skate parks? i know the width of the contact patch can make a difference in maneuverability and whatnot, but i think that kind of goes with the roundness (or lack thereof) of the wheels' edges. is there anything else, like a particular type of wheel hub or something, that i should look for in a set of park wheels? and would it be a noticeable difference to someone pretty much just getting started?

i've only skated at parks a few times and i was using hybrids. i'm considering getting some kind of harder wheel (possibly dual purpose for park and rinks) or maybe the moxi fundaes, if they happen to be in stock when i'm buying.

and just out of curiosity - on a bit of a broader note, is there really a difference between the less specialized indoor or artistic wheels vs park wheels? by ""less specialized,"" i mean that i know there are some wheels that are considered really good for a particular kind of skating (whether that's park, jam, speed, derby, etc.), but i feel like the more middle-of-the-road ones aren't all that different as long as they're hard and not too square (like some derby-specific wheels seem to be).",know sure grip fame wheel marketed artistic wheel seem basically park wheel hard small ish x mm look square edge sure grip royal artistic wheel rollerbones team wheel seem kinda generic particular reason good skate park know width contact patch make difference maneuverability whatnot think kind go roundness lack thereof wheel edge anything else like particular type wheel hub something look set park wheel would noticeable difference someone pretty much getting started skated park time using hybrid considering getting kind harder wheel possibly dual purpose park rink maybe moxi fundaes happen stock buying curiosity bit broader note really difference le specialized indoor artistic wheel v park wheel le specialized mean know wheel considered really good particular kind skating whether park jam speed derby etc feel like middle road one different long hard square like derby specific wheel seem,"['know', 'sure', 'grip', 'fame', 'wheel', 'marketed', 'artistic', 'wheel', 'seem', 'basically', 'park', 'wheel', 'hard', 'small', 'ish', 'x', 'mm', 'look', 'square', 'edge', 'sure', 'grip', 'royal', 'artistic', 'wheel', 'rollerbones', 'team', 'wheel', 'seem', 'kinda', 'generic', 'particular', 'reason', 'good', 'skate', 'park', 'know', 'width', 'contact', 'patch', 'make', 'difference', 'maneuverability', 'whatnot', 'think', 'kind', 'go', 'roundness', 'lack', 'thereof', 'wheel', 'edge', 'anything', 'else', 'like', 'particular', 'type', 'wheel', 'hub', 'something', 'look', 'set', 'park', 'wheel', 'would', 'noticeable', 'difference', 'someone', 'pretty', 'much', 'getting', 'started', 'skated', 'park', 'time', 'using', 'hybrid', 'considering', 'getting', 'kind', 'harder', 'wheel', 'possibly', 'dual', 'purpose', 'park', 'rink', 'maybe', 'moxi', 'fundaes', 'happen', 'stock', 'buying', 'curiosity', 'bit', 'broader', 'note', 'really', 'difference', 'le', 'specialized', 'indoor', 'artistic', 'wheel', 'v', 'park', 'wheel', 'le', 'specialized', 'mean', 'know', 'wheel', 'considered', 'really', 'good', 'particular', 'kind', 'skating', 'whether', 'park', 'jam', 'speed', 'derby', 'etc', 'feel', 'like', 'middle', 'road', 'one', 'different', 'long', 'hard', 'square', 'like', 'derby', 'specific', 'wheel', 'seem']",138

3045,rookie artistic roller skate review,Rollerskating,"Hi folks! 👋

I know, the most popular and desired skates now are Moxi skates (judging by billions of posts on different online platforms) 
I think we can find tonnes of unboxing videos for Lollies and Beach Bunnies while their specs are learned by heart. 

So, I want to offer you my review of not so well known roller skates - Artistics by the British brand Rookie Skates. 

I bought my pair of Artistics after skating on Beach Bunnies for over two months, so it's definitely not my first (and not the second) pair of skates and I can compare. 

So, in general the Artistics' boots look rather similar to BB: it's made of vinyl, it's padded with plushy lining inside, it has aluminum plates with steel trucks and adjustable toe stops. 
However, Rookie's skates are only produced in two colours - black and white, while BB have a bunch of bright colourful designs. 

Another significant difference from the BB is the rubber foam lining of the tongue - the Artistic skates also have a foam lining but it's definitely not rubber, just some cheap foam. 

And that's where the similarities between the two skates end because even though they Artistic boots look somehow similar to BB ones, they're definitely shaped differently. 

Artistic boots are rather narrow that's why some people say that their sizing is on the smaller side. To my opinion, it's definitely not! My feet are about 235-236mm long and I usually wear UK 4/ EU 37, so when I had bought my Artistics in the same size they fitted me just perfectly (but the regular boots fit me slightly more loose because they have wider foot beds) 

Artistics' boots aren't very stiff and they didn't even required breaking in time - to my feet, their mold is just perfect! However, I must say that the boots scuff really easily if you fall on the asphalt. 

Another thing I really love about Artistics - it's their padding around the ankles - it's well defined and feels really comfortable. 

As for the plates - well, I've never tried fancy plates but in comparison with BB I feel like I definitely have more control over the wheels. I feel definitely more agile! 

The wheels are 80A and they're surprisingly good and shock absorbing for the skates that cost just about €95-100 (yet I preferred to change them for softer 78A wheels) 

So, in my very personal opinion the comfort and agility of Rookie Artistic skates outweigh the imperfections they have. 
Honestly, I'd be happy if Rookie started producing right the same type of boots but in a ''deluxe'' more durable version even if it would cost like Beach Bunnies! 


But if you have wider feet, probably you'd rather opt for some other budget skates (said BB or Rainbow Riders, or maybe Crazy Skates which have pretty roomy fit)

3065,lower back pain beginner mo sway back posture,Rollerskating,"Hi all,

So, I’ve read about lower back pain with beginners that don’t have enough core strength and I think this is partly at play here. 
I’m about 5 weeks into skating, and today just realized (from seeing my shadow), that while I thought I was skating upright with a straight back, I wasn’t.

- I am still a bit hunched. Not a whole lot, but enough that it’s noticeable.

- I have pretty bad sway back posture (forward neck and shoulders, curved spine, jutting out butt). This posture is an issue I have had since I was twelve, I have not been able to correct it in adulthood. My back is like this always. To straighten my spine I have to bend my knees, otherwise it’s curved. 

So my skating position is awkward. My knees are very bent, I’m leaning forward a tad, and my butt sticks out. I also look stiff af.

Considering my longtime posture problem, do I just need to strengthen and engage my core, or is there something else at play? 
I am reluctant to go see a chiro or physiologist right now with the virus surge in my area... so I thought I’d give this board a shot. 

Does anyone have experience or advice with this pb?",hi read lower back pain beginner enough core strength think partly play week skating today realized seeing shadow thought skating upright straight back still bit hunched whole lot enough noticeable pretty bad sway back posture forward neck shoulder curved spine jutting butt posture issue since twelve able correct adulthood back like always straighten spine bend knee otherwise curved skating position awkward knee bent leaning forward tad butt stick also look stiff af considering longtime posture problem need strengthen engage core something else play reluctant go see chiro physiologist right virus surge area thought give board shot anyone experience advice pb,"['hi', 'read', 'lower', 'back', 'pain', 'beginner', 'enough', 'core', 'strength', 'think', 'partly', 'play', 'week', 'skating', 'today', 'realized', 'seeing', 'shadow', 'thought', 'skating', 'upright', 'straight', 'back', 'still', 'bit', 'hunched', 'whole', 'lot', 'enough', 'noticeable', 'pretty', 'bad', 'sway', 'back', 'posture', 'forward', 'neck', 'shoulder', 'curved', 'spine', 'jutting', 'butt', 'posture', 'issue', 'since', 'twelve', 'able', 'correct', 'adulthood', 'back', 'like', 'always', 'straighten', 'spine', 'bend', 'knee', 'otherwise', 'curved', 'skating', 'position', 'awkward', 'knee', 'bent', 'leaning', 'forward', 'tad', 'butt', 'stick', 'also', 'look', 'stiff', 'af', 'considering', 'longtime', 'posture', 'problem', 'need', 'strengthen', 'engage', 'core', 'something', 'else', 'play', 'reluctant', 'go', 'see', 'chiro', 'physiologist', 'right', 'virus', 'surge', 'area', 'thought', 'give', 'board', 'shot', 'anyone', 'experience', 'advice', 'pb']",100

3201,long got pat,Rollerskating,"hey all. so i'm a newish skater... i started way back in late may. i practice inconsistently, anywhere between every day to once in two weeks depending on life circumstances. i've been feeling... not quite frustrated, but uninformed, about how long it takes before a skill becomes second nature. 

for the first month, every time i strapped in, i had to consistently practice staggering my feet, or turning, or stopping. but eventually that became second nature, and i no longer have to practice those things. the same thing re: manuals, crossovers, going backwards, shoot the ducks, etc. where i don't *really* ""warm up"" for those skills or tricks. those skills/tricks are in themselves warm-ups for the things i'm currently trying to learn. 

the currently-learning skills include transitions, or spinning, but it feels like in a single session i can go from falling all over the place to getting it down pretty well, only for it to all disappear by the next session (even if that session's only 2-3 days out from the last practice). 

it seems like people generally get transitions down within a month. i've been practicing for months and i still struggle depending on the surface i'm on and the speed i'm going. if i take a few days break, i feel like i start again from ground zero, instead of a place between total beginner and my highest performance. 

and i can't determine if that's because: 

1) the skills i'm learning now are harder and take longer to ""get down"" 

2) some skills are not only harder, but also impossible to definitively ""get down"" for long periods of time (e.g. i could stop skating for a month and will still know how to turn once i strap back in, but that'll never be true for transitions or spinning, no matter the skill level) 

3) it's less a skill thing and more that my muscles are straight up too weak at the moment (lol) 

**how long did it take for you guys to learn:** 

* going straight w/ staggered feet 
* turning
* crossovers
* manuals (heel toe, toe toe, heel heel, whatever) 
* front-to-back transitions
* going backwards
* spinning (heel toe? toe toe? were those different learning processes?) 
* back-to-front transitions 
* crosspulls
* sideskating 
* waltz jumps
* ...whatever else you think is a beginner to intermediate skill

After some cost calculations, it made the most sense to get another 3-pack. I chose the tie dye Saver Series 3-pack from Triple8, because I have a rainbow sweat saver helmet from them that I love and they match. 

Well these Triple8 pads are significantly lower quality than the Impala pads. Like *significantly* significantly. They have maybe half as much padding (if that) and the plastic cup seems way less sturdy. I’m worried it will crack. 

Honesty I’m afraid to fall on these pads. I feel much safer in the Impala pads, but the colors aren’t my style and they look dumb over pants, so I guess I’m sticking to these for the time being.

I can’t try on her skates because we are way different sizes. I also really like the Allen key for the toe stop...

3284,winter advice encouragement,Rollerskating,"Hi everyone! I started skating this summer and was really happy with all my progress. Skating really got me into shape and greatly helped my mental health during Covid. 

Today was the first day the area I live in got its first true snowfall and my region is also going into lockdown for at least the next month. I'm worried about losing my momentum with skating and don't want to lose all the skills I gained this summer and fall. I was wondering if anyone had any advice on getting through the winter months. During a normal year I would try and go to a rink or indoor skate park but I very much doubt that will be something that can happen this year. 

I admit seeing everyone's videos and tiktoks with sunshine and shorts has me quite envious. BUT I am determined to keep my chin up so I thought I'd ask for some advice from this wonderful sub.

Are there any indoor exercises or drills I should work on in the upcoming months? I've started painting my skates and making new toe caps but are there any other projects I haven't thought of?  I've never been so excited about a physical activity so any way I can continue to be involved with roller skating would be great!

my skates have plastic trucks which, at the time of buying, i didn’t really think about for a few reasons. mainly because i’m a COMPLETE beginner but also since none of the reviews mentioned anything about the trucks and i couldn’t find a single youtube video reviewing them. it simply just didn’t cross my mind, and after i did think about which direction i wanted to go in with my skating i’ve now decided that i want to learn tricks and skate at the skatepark. this is a problem because i don’t want to shatter the plastic trucks when attempting stuff like that. 

basically i’m just wondering; should i just wait until these brand new skates i just got a few weeks ago are completely worn out and i’m ready to replace them? or should i just get new ones with metal trucks for my birthday which is 4 months away and have 2 pairs of skates? what would you do?",week ago bought relatively cheap beginner skate get started hobby skated since know like continue skate plastic truck time buying really think reason mainly complete beginner also since none review mentioned anything truck find single youtube video reviewing simply cross mind think direction wanted go skating decided want learn trick skate skatepark problem want shatter plastic truck attempting stuff like basically wondering wait brand new skate got week ago completely worn ready replace get new one metal truck birthday month away pair skate would,"['week', 'ago', 'bought', 'relatively', 'cheap', 'beginner', 'skate', 'get', 'started', 'hobby', 'skated', 'since', 'know', 'like', 'continue', 'skate', 'plastic', 'truck', 'time', 'buying', 'really', 'think', 'reason', 'mainly', 'complete', 'beginner', 'also', 'since', 'none', 'review', 'mentioned', 'anything', 'truck', 'find', 'single', 'youtube', 'video', 'reviewing', 'simply', 'cross', 'mind', 'think', 'direction', 'wanted', 'go', 'skating', 'decided', 'want', 'learn', 'trick', 'skate', 'skatepark', 'problem', 'want', 'shatter', 'plastic', 'truck', 'attempting', 'stuff', 'like', 'basically', 'wondering', 'wait', 'brand', 'new', 'skate', 'got', 'week', 'ago', 'completely', 'worn', 'ready', 'replace', 'get', 'new', 'one', 'metal', 'truck', 'birthday', 'month', 'away', 'pair', 'skate', 'would']",84

3396,stock avenger arius plate learning,Rollerskating,"I’m currently learning on Moxi Lolly skates and I love them! But as I learn more about skating, I’ve now been reading about the different plates, action, cushions, etc. 

If money was not an obstacle, what should I learn / build my skills on? The stock plates (and switch the cushions for the softer red ones), the Avenger Magnesium plates or the Arius plates? 

I am gravitating toward rhythm skating, flowing with the music and making up my own choreography as I go. Will mainly be outdoors and purely for fun, no derby. Increased maneuverability sounds awesome, and the more I read about the Arius plates the more they appeal to me. 

I have some questions that have been difficult to answer despite many Google searches:
-Coming from a 10 degree plate, what would the learning curve be like switching to either of the above? 
-Is this a situation where I should do a progression (10, to 45, then to Arius)? 
-Or should I switch now to the Avengers and then once my skills are better, upgrade to the Arius? 
-OR are the Arius plates so different than 10 or 45 degree plates, and if they really are incredible once you learn how to use them, should I go straight to those and relearn what skills I have now? 


Essentially, should I have a certain baseline of skills before upgrading my plates in favor of increased maneuverability? For context, I’m definitely still building up my leg muscles and strength. 

Thank you for any perspective you all can give. I definitely want to respect the learning process and don’t want to cut corners! But if different plates will allow me to grow as a skater more quickly or efficiently, I’d like to explore that option.",currently learning moxi lolly skate love learn skating reading different plate action cushion etc money obstacle learn build skill stock plate switch cushion softer red one avenger magnesium plate arius plate gravitating toward rhythm skating flowing music making choreography go mainly outdoors purely fun derby increased maneuverability sound awesome read arius plate appeal question difficult answer despite many google search coming degree plate would learning curve like switching either situation progression arius switch avenger skill better upgrade arius arius plate different degree plate really incredible learn use go straight relearn skill essentially certain baseline skill upgrading plate favor increased maneuverability context definitely still building leg muscle strength thank perspective give definitely want respect learning process want cut corner different plate allow grow skater quickly efficiently like explore option,"['currently', 'learning', 'moxi', 'lolly', 'skate', 'love', 'learn', 'skating', 'reading', 'different', 'plate', 'action', 'cushion', 'etc', 'money', 'obstacle', 'learn', 'build', 'skill', 'stock', 'plate', 'switch', 'cushion', 'softer', 'red', 'one', 'avenger', 'magnesium', 'plate', 'arius', 'plate', 'gravitating', 'toward', 'rhythm', 'skating', 'flowing', 'music', 'making', 'choreography', 'go', 'mainly', 'outdoors', 'purely', 'fun', 'derby', 'increased', 'maneuverability', 'sound', 'awesome', 'read', 'arius', 'plate', 'appeal', 'question', 'difficult', 'answer', 'despite', 'many', 'google', 'search', 'coming', 'degree', 'plate', 'would', 'learning', 'curve', 'like', 'switching', 'either', 'situation', 'progression', 'arius', 'switch', 'avenger', 'skill', 'better', 'upgrade', 'arius', 'arius', 'plate', 'different', 'degree', 'plate', 'really', 'incredible', 'learn', 'use', 'go', 'straight', 'relearn', 'skill', 'essentially', 'certain', 'baseline', 'skill', 'upgrading', 'plate', 'favor', 'increased', 'maneuverability', 'context', 'definitely', 'still', 'building', 'leg', 'muscle', 'strength', 'thank', 'perspective', 'give', 'definitely', 'want', 'respect', 'learning', 'process', 'want', 'cut', 'corner', 'different', 'plate', 'allow', 'grow', 'skater', 'quickly', 'efficiently', 'like', 'explore', 'option']",128

I don't know about you but I have a real problem finding decent places to skate here, I've had police called on me, been kicked out of alleys and empty parking lots, not allowed on courts, not allowed in parks or cemeteries, no drivers here actually stop at stop signs, the bike baths are filled with homeless encampments, loose dogs, trash and that's if they are even paved. They cross-traffic every 2 minutes and the 2 outdoor hockey rinks - 1 in mar vista, is being accessed by jumping a fence, and the other one in noho is locked and empty because the fence is too tall to scale. There is a roller blade open space in santa monica but get this, the surface is too rough to skate there! Beach paths are now filled with electric bikes and scooters (not allowed but nobody enforces) and the dam is great, but it's not safe and we're not allowed to be there either.

We have the weather for an outdoor skate space (like Anacostia in DC or Discovery Green in Houston) but I need help, I don't know how to get started or who to contact. Does anyone have experience or ideas? I'm not really a leader and more of a collaborator so I don't where to go with this idea?

Anyways I want to buy my first pair of rollerskates for jam skating but I don’t know where to begin. I’d like to spend less than $200 but I know I want to do this for a while so I may spend more if I find it necessary. Anyways I was looking at Riedell R3 and Suregrip Rock GT50 because everyone says they are good value for a beginner. I also saw Bont Prostar for just under $200 and it’s looks like better quality but I’d like to hear from y’all. I’ve also seen the Vanilla Jr. lineup that are right around $200 so if anyone could tell me about the quality of those I’d appreciate it. Lastly I saw the Jackson Elite Viper Alloy Skates and they look really nice too but they’re $300. I can provide a link to each skate so that y’all have a visual. These are all low cut which is what I’ve heard is used for jam skating but if y’all could explain why I would buy a high top pair I’d consider it. Mainly I want something comfortable and not super flashy. Im tired of using the rental skates because of how stiff they feel (my goal is to get to be super flowy like the rlly good ppl you see at skating rinks). Also, my foot tends to run a bit wide so if any of these model are super narrow then that would put them out of the question for me. Thanks!

I've got C7/Skate Gear and the trucks have gone wobbly. Not in the part where the nut is--I can tighten that completely and still have the same issue. It's the other part where the metal of the truck goes up into the plate. It has gotten very loose and when I pick up my foot it feels like  my wheels are dangling from my skates, and it's causing some weird directional ""pulling"" issues too.

Is this a part of skates breaking in over time, or do I need to hop off these wheels before something snaps and kills me? I really thought I'd have boot failure before hardware failure. 

I can't be skateless, so at this point I'm looking at an emergency pair of tan boardwalks and canceling my mirrorballs from Moonlight since they show no sign of shipping. I've already got suede dye for the MBs, so tan is no great loss.

3450,looking freestyle plate recommendation,Rollerskating,"**edit**: *quad* freestyle plate   
Hi! I'm a figure skater who got skates (""vintage"" *derby* skates, of all things, but don't judge, I'm on a budget lol) from ebay recently, and am looking to get a new pair of skates.

So basically I'm looking to do quad freestyle and artistic skating in a middle-difficulty range.

In terms of level, I had gotten all of my single jumps and axel (and lost it xD) by the last time I was on ice. My former coach said I jump pretty high, so I reasoned to get some boots on the stiffer end for prelim/juv.

I reasoned that trying to buy a complete skate for my criteria was probably rarer, and more expensive than I would want. Finding and buying adequate boots has been reasonable, but I'm stuck on **plates and mounting**. I'm planning to call some local rinks and ask if they mount, or in the worse case, mount skates myself, but for plates I can find no good guide or masterlist for ""good"" plates and respective ratings (I'm guessing double action plates are a must, and a plate that is sensitive, but not too sensitive to movements), so I'm stuck :C.

So I'm looking to get a middle-range (that can support freestyle, single jumps) plate within the $100 range. I reason I might also be able to buy a plate secondhand so any recommendations for plates in the $100-200 range or less that are good for freestyle would be appreciated--note I *would* buy roll line but roll line is definitely out of my budget.",edit quad freestyle plate hi figure skater got skate vintage derby skate thing judge budget lol ebay recently looking get new pair skate basically looking quad freestyle artistic skating middle difficulty range term level gotten single jump axel lost xd last time ice former coach said jump pretty high reasoned get boot stiffer end prelim juv reasoned trying buy complete skate criterion probably rarer expensive would want finding buying adequate boot reasonable stuck plate mounting planning call local rink ask mount worse case mount skate plate find good guide masterlist good plate respective rating guessing double action plate must plate sensitive sensitive movement stuck c looking get middle range support freestyle single jump plate within range reason might also able buy plate secondhand recommendation plate range le good freestyle would appreciated note would buy roll line roll line definitely budget,"['edit', 'quad', 'freestyle', 'plate', 'hi', 'figure', 'skater', 'got', 'skate', 'vintage', 'derby', 'skate', 'thing', 'judge', 'budget', 'lol', 'ebay', 'recently', 'looking', 'get', 'new', 'pair', 'skate', 'basically', 'looking', 'quad', 'freestyle', 'artistic', 'skating', 'middle', 'difficulty', 'range', 'term', 'level', 'gotten', 'single', 'jump', 'axel', 'lost', 'xd', 'last', 'time', 'ice', 'former', 'coach', 'said', 'jump', 'pretty', 'high', 'reasoned', 'get', 'boot', 'stiffer', 'end', 'prelim', 'juv', 'reasoned', 'trying', 'buy', 'complete', 'skate', 'criterion', 'probably', 'rarer', 'expensive', 'would', 'want', 'finding', 'buying', 'adequate', 'boot', 'reasonable', 'stuck', 'plate', 'mounting', 'planning', 'call', 'local', 'rink', 'ask', 'mount', 'worse', 'case', 'mount', 'skate', 'plate', 'find', 'good', 'guide', 'masterlist', 'good', 'plate', 'respective', 'rating', 'guessing', 'double', 'action', 'plate', 'must', 'plate', 'sensitive', 'sensitive', 'movement', 'stuck', 'c', 'looking', 'get', 'middle', 'range', 'support', 'freestyle', 'single', 'jump', 'plate', 'within', 'range', 'reason', 'might', 'also', 'able', 'buy', 'plate', 'secondhand', 'recommendation', 'plate', 'range', 'le', 'good', 'freestyle', 'would', 'appreciated', 'note', 'would', 'buy', 'roll', 'line', 'roll', 'line', 'definitely', 'budget']",140

I would like to open a topic!!

I'm a beginner and I have my Moxi Beach Bunny for one month, I love them really much!

I couldn't resist and I just bought the black Lolly in size 6. I hope that the Lolly size 6 will be fine (I'm a europe half size 37,5,  Moxi 5 is 37 and Moxi 6 is 38) My Moxi Beach Bunny in size 5 were so tight at the beginning (I thought they were too small for one foot) but now they feel way better and comfortable even though I had to loosen up the laces and they are pretty difficult to put on and off sometimes. I also heard that the Moxi Lolly are really narrow... So I'm guessing and hoping that size 6 will be good. 

I think that having 2 pairs will be pretty good (I'm trying to be rational here haha). I'm still a beginner and do mostly street skating but I'm planning to move on to the skate park in the future.

I was thinking about how if I were to post pics, I'd want to be way prettier and would need a lot of make up and then I asked myself *why?* 

There are so many pictures and videos of women of all shapes, sizes, and colors and in the comments, constant praise at their skill, technique and improvement. 

And even agreements like, ""I have long legs as well and this is what I do,"" or ""I have thick thighs and this helps me."" 

And all the cheering on of progress, no matter how small! 

It doesn't make sense to have a lower standard for myself when I want to uplift other women too. I realized there are safe spaces where we can lift each other up and to generalize and say that ""women are catty"" or ""women are cliquey"" is a straight up lie. 

Girls are cliquey and girls are catty. 

If there's things that separates boys from the men then there are standards that separate girls from the women too. 

It's a profound realization that has changed my whole perspective on being a woman and celebrating my fellow sisters. I'm so proud of you all and I'm done being an outsider looking in - I plan to find some skates of my own and join the club. 

It will probably be next year and I probably won't be very good but I have all of you to help me and that is such a good feeling to have. 

It's so wholesome and means so much to me and I wanted to thank you all for sharing yourselves with me. For being so open and honest about your struggles. For the constant reminders to wear safety gear and masks. 

That no matter what, we all just want to have fun and we should be having fun. And we should be enjoying each other's company and we should be supporting each other. 

I know that isn't the intent of this sub but it's the impact it's had on me and I just wanted to share and say thank you for being the bold, beautiful woman you are and for leading by example.",lurking sub long time besides skate video cool content put finger scrolling sub like usually hit see many woman complimenting one another mother grandmother raised u believe woman competition opted break cycle gotten close friend work mentioned roller skating mentioned used roller blade would join endeavor thinking post pic want way prettier would need lot make asked many picture video woman shape size color comment constant praise skill technique improvement even agreement like long leg well thick thigh help cheering progress matter small make sense lower standard want uplift woman realized safe space lift generalize say woman catty woman cliquey straight lie girl cliquey girl catty thing separate boy men standard separate girl woman profound realization changed whole perspective woman celebrating fellow sister proud done outsider looking plan find skate join club probably next year probably good help good feeling wholesome mean much wanted thank sharing open honest struggle constant reminder wear safety gear mask matter want fun fun enjoying company supporting know intent sub impact wanted share say thank bold beautiful woman leading example,"['lurking', 'sub', 'long', 'time', 'besides', 'skate', 'video', 'cool', 'content', 'put', 'finger', 'scrolling', 'sub', 'like', 'usually', 'hit', 'see', 'many', 'woman', 'complimenting', 'one', 'another', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'raised', 'u', 'believe', 'woman', 'competition', 'opted', 'break', 'cycle', 'gotten', 'close', 'friend', 'work', 'mentioned', 'roller', 'skating', 'mentioned', 'used', 'roller', 'blade', 'would', 'join', 'endeavor', 'thinking', 'post', 'pic', 'want', 'way', 'prettier', 'would', 'need', 'lot', 'make', 'asked', 'many', 'picture', 'video', 'woman', 'shape', 'size', 'color', 'comment', 'constant', 'praise', 'skill', 'technique', 'improvement', 'even', 'agreement', 'like', 'long', 'leg', 'well', 'thick', 'thigh', 'help', 'cheering', 'progress', 'matter', 'small', 'make', 'sense', 'lower', 'standard', 'want', 'uplift', 'woman', 'realized', 'safe', 'space', 'lift', 'generalize', 'say', 'woman', 'catty', 'woman', 'cliquey', 'straight', 'lie', 'girl', 'cliquey', 'girl', 'catty', 'thing', 'separate', 'boy', 'men', 'standard', 'separate', 'girl', 'woman', 'profound', 'realization', 'changed', 'whole', 'perspective', 'woman', 'celebrating', 'fellow', 'sister', 'proud', 'done', 'outsider', 'looking', 'plan', 'find', 'skate', 'join', 'club', 'probably', 'next', 'year', 'probably', 'good', 'help', 'good', 'feeling', 'wholesome', 'mean', 'much', 'wanted', 'thank', 'sharing', 'open', 'honest', 'struggle', 'constant', 'reminder', 'wear', 'safety', 'gear', 'mask', 'matter', 'want', 'fun', 'fun', 'enjoying', 'company', 'supporting', 'know', 'intent', 'sub', 'impact', 'wanted', 'share', 'say', 'thank', 'bold', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'leading', 'example']",175

I recently got a pair of Impalas, they are my first set of quads in my adult life. Because skates are such a hot commodity, I jumped at the chance when the shop I went to had my size. I regret not doing more research (they had Moxie beach bunnies but i liked how the Impalas fit) but had I known what I know now, I would have gone with the Bunnies. 

Anyway, now I have Impalas and I'm wondering if anyone has attempted to preemptively reinforce the boot to the soul to ensure it doesn't come apart. I'm super nervous of them separating so I check them each time before I use them and planning on reinforcing them with a strong clear flexible adhesive either now before they split or wait till they do. I've used the E-200 glue on a number of materials and find it in to be pretty reliable.

3667,hydration backpack v fanny pack water bottle trail skating worried balance,Rollerskating,"Hello! I recently started trail skating and was wondering what's the best way to carry water/phone/etc. without affecting balance? I am a relatively new skater and have only recently started trail skating. I average about 4 miles now and am ready to skate longer distances, but many of the longer trails do not have water stations. 

I keep my phone in a pelican G40 case for safety, so I would need a relatively roomy fanny pack. That is why I am considering a hydration backpack as well. Do either of them really affect your balance, or is it just something to get used to? If you have any recommendations please let me know!

3690,terminal terminology crisis crossover criss cross crosspull,Rollerskating,"Because I'm finding it hard to look for tutorials when I haven't got the names right, I'd looove some groupthink on the difference between crossovers, criss-cross, crosspulls and etc.

I'm working on what I think is backwards swizzle, but, my teacher calls it backwards crossovers, but when I search for backwards crossovers, naturally I get the derby move where you try to keep your speed while turning.  

So, this list is where I've got to so far:

**Bubbles** \- legs do not cross, done forwards and backwards

**Scissors** \- same as bubbles

**Criss-cross** \- Similar to bubbles but you cross your legs across each other while moving forward or backwards. Feet don't lift up. You may alternate which foot goes in front each time or you may stick to one foot. 

**Slalom** \- same as criss-cross

**Swizzle** \- I feel this should be the same as criss-cross but I have heard people use it to refer to bubbles. Also some people say ""twizzle"" or am I just mishearing?

**Weaving** \- ??? Means many things depending on context?

**Crossovers** \- done while turning, when going forwards involves lifting the outer foot up and placing it down crossing in front of the inner foot. Also done backwards (but the steps are reversed)

**Crosspulls** \- the same as crossovers.

I've been a recreational figure skater for 5 years, but with the rinks closed wanted to branch out and try something new that seems like so much fun!

I'm bending my knees, and really working to tighten my core and pull my groin muscles towards each other and be on the inside edge of my skates. However, I'm only able to bubble 2-3 times before I lose momentum. Is it normal to have to push off normally, and not just have the bubble power me forward? I'm using Beach Bunnies on a basketball court for frame of reference. Sorry not to have a video to share!

Just wanted to let you all know about something very suspicious that happened to my skatepro order today.

I was super psyched to order from them -- i got light up wheels, bearings, new cushions, and bearing oil. Spent more than $100 total. Paid for shipping.

Well I received my package today and EVERYTHING is missing from my order except the (very cheap) bearing oil. When I called, they had an automated menu item that said ""press 3 if items are missing from your order"" which immediately made me suspicious because that must mean it happens often. When I spoke to an agent, she asked me if the package had ""extra tape"" on it. It did. She then suggested that FedEx took the items out of my package. Again, this made me think this happens to them often. I've placed plenty of international orders of all kinds and I've never experienced anything like this.

They said they probably wouldn't look into it until tomorrow. Overall I'm very irritated and disappointed right now. They didn't seem to have any sense of urgency or really care about my missing package on the phone. I'll update this if they fix it, but overall I'm pretty suspicious right now. I probably won't order from them again unless they fix it very quickly, because it seems like they have an issue with keeping track of order items.

The site from which I'm trying to purchase states that US 10 runs for 43 EU and I'm confused. What chart should i trust? EU 40-41 is perfect for my feet but 43 is too much.

3758,waiting mlr preorder cancel still,Rollerskating,"I preordered the night fevers from a store located near me (kinda). Fortunately, I still have the option to cancel for a full refund. Anyways, I just joined reddit and have seen the overwhelmingly mixed reviews. I'm concerned with the amount of quality issues I've seen people note. I know that with almost any skate you'll have to replace the stock plates/trucks/wheel eventually and I'm willing to invest down the road. For the time being I'm still pretty new to skating, I've barely begun practicing tricks, therefore I dont believe I should have any problems with the plate snapping or anything for rn. I guess the overwhelming feeling I'm getting is either 1. Take the risk and upgrade the skate in the face of any issues 2. Wait for a couple more years when this company has had more time to establish themselves and improve quality. 

My two main questions are:
1. Is worth it?
2. What are other good quality brands I can switch to?

I know the first question is quite subjective so I understand if that is a challenging question to answer.

3759,question,Rollerskating,"I’ve been working on 180s and had recently changed up how I do them when turning them into a stop. I have my right foot forward, turn to my left, then have my left foot forward going backwards and I can toe stop. These are really simple (since I don’t need much power) and make it easy to stop.

But, when it comes to 180s on ramps (and eventually out of bowls) I feel like I’ll need to do a full transition, where I have my right foot forward and I turn to my right and bring my right foot back forwards going down the ramp.

My question is, is there anything wrong with having two different 180 methods for different things? I’m turning in two different directions for these, so I don’t know if it’s less confusing to make them the same turning direction or if I should stick with the way I’m doing it.

3793,worth holding onto basic candi girl wheel,Rollerskating,"I’m a pretty new skater and I’m starting to dip my toes into skate mechanics stuff as I need to. I bought some new outdoor wheels yesterday because the original wheels on my candi girl skates were rolling so poorly (I also really wanted new colors) I realize I probably could have just got them some new bearings and they would have been good as new so now I feel super wasteful. Was it worth buying completely new wheels? And If so, are the original wheels a decent enough quality to hold onto and replace the bearings at a later time? I know candi girls aren’t the best quality and the wheels I bought were almost the same cost as the skates themselves so I know they’ll be good.

3796,stood skate,Rollerskating,"I got a pair of Derby brand Driftrs like three days ago. I loosened the wheels and trucks right away, put them on, padded up, and tried to stand in my bedroom. I immediately fell on my butt, and since the wood laminate floors are a little...soft? it made a huge rumble through the house and almost tipped over the tall bookshelf in the next room. My partner and my roommate called out to check on me, and I laughed it off, but it really discouraged me. I felt so bulky and clumsy, I’m already insecure about my weight, and I just kind of sat there on the floor in my skates and almost cried. I had to take them off after that. 
A couple days went by where I said I would try again, I even re-adjusted the skates and put on my new laces. I just couldn’t bring myself to try to skate. I get insecure doing anything that makes me look vulnerable, and it’s kind of debilitating. 
Well, today I got back on! I swept all the leaves and acorns off the big front deck, put away the furniture, and spent like half an hour just practicing standing up from a kneeling position, engaging my muscles to keep steady, and falling on my kneepads. I even wound up doing a couple half-bubbles? But boy have I lost most of my leg muscle from being unemployed. I didn’t last too long before my legs turned to jelly and I didn’t wanna push it. 
Bottom line, I got back on! It’s a little milestone and I still have what seems like forever to go, but I feel good about myself for trying, even just a little bit. I just wanted to share this because I’m feeling hopeful and I wanted to share my experience as a brand-spankin’ new skater for anyone else who’s too scared to lace up.

3803,skating turned anatomy nerd im looking exercise skate feel strength leg,Rollerskating,"Only because I want to become a great skater, I’ve worked on my arch support, ankle strength, hip mobility, and core strength. Im so thrilled to be on the road to healthy walking strength. I’ve really struggled so much and even tried physical therapy. I had no idea skating would make the sources of all my issues so glaringly obvious! 

I’m obsessed with symmetry so if I learn to do something on one leg, I immediately try to mirror it on the other side. Today I discovered that when I thought my left hip was too tight to have my left leg be loose and lead with the left foot (like when you put the foot in front and do a wheelie), what was actuallyyyyy happening was my right glute was too weak to support the same movements my left glute can handle. After doing some glute activation exercises, my skate posture feels incredible and my hips finally open all the way up with a good squeeze of the butt! 

If anyone with flat feet/knee knocking issues like me wants a good activator for your butt to open up your hips, I like squatting heel to heel in my skates, clenching my butt (and core!), and then alternating scooting left then right then left... a few inches at a time just by clenching one butt cheek more back and forth! 

Enough about butts!

Who has done this? Did you have any issues with the mount (i.e. holes being in the wrong place forcing a suboptimal mount... I know you can fill holes but I’m assuming there needs to be space between the old holes the new holes?) 
How does the falcon perform at the skate park and for general outdoor skating? I’m a little hesitant about using a 16 degree plate after bad experiences with 45 plates in the early days of playing roller derby, but I’ve heard such good things about this plate.

3854,best way contact moonlight roller,Rollerskating,"Soooo... like a lot of people, I pounced at the opportunity to buy a pair of Moonlight rollerskates. I got the Charmer snake print ones late August, and they arrived two days ago. I was really hoping these would be my ""nice"" indoor-only skates, but now I just want them to be returned and refunded tbh.

* Firstly, on each skate, one of the wheels doesn't touch the ground until you're in the boots putting more weight on them. 
* Second, the front trucks are tilted so much that I veer to the left trying to go straight. 
* The cushions are so uneven (and extremely stiff) and this may be making the above problems worse
* The boot is NICE. Love the boot. However, with shipping these were $292 and this skate does NOT reflect that at all. Everything besides the boot is literally the same stuff on Impala or C7 skates (which were my first pair and 1/3 the price).
* Took the skates to my local shop to try replacing the cushions. Didn't fix the truck issues. It just felt like they were completely working against me. The shop owner was shocked to see the quality of the plate. It's scuffed and looks like it's already been used for years.

So after troubleshooting it and spending extra money to hopefully fix it, I'm left with essentially unskatable skates. I already messaged the moonlightsupport instagram but I'm concerned they won't see it. I tried to change the shipping address on my order 3 weeks ago since it got extended more and more and I was moving. They never replied. I'm terrified they're going to leave me with these $300 skates I can't and don't want to use. 

Anyone have tips for successfully connecting with them??",soooo like lot people pounced opportunity buy pair moonlight rollerskates got charmer snake print one late august arrived two day ago really hoping would nice indoor skate want returned refunded tbh firstly skate one wheel touch ground boot putting weight second front truck tilted much veer left trying go straight cushion uneven extremely stiff may making problem worse boot nice love boot however shipping skate reflect everything besides boot literally stuff impala c skate first pair price took skate local shop try replacing cushion fix truck issue felt like completely working shop owner shocked see quality plate scuffed look like already used year troubleshooting spending extra money hopefully fix left essentially unskatable skate already messaged moonlightsupport instagram concerned see tried change shipping address order week ago since got extended moving never replied terrified going leave skate want use anyone tip successfully connecting,"['soooo', 'like', 'lot', 'people', 'pounced', 'opportunity', 'buy', 'pair', 'moonlight', 'rollerskates', 'got', 'charmer', 'snake', 'print', 'one', 'late', 'august', 'arrived', 'two', 'day', 'ago', 'really', 'hoping', 'would', 'nice', 'indoor', 'skate', 'want', 'returned', 'refunded', 'tbh', 'firstly', 'skate', 'one', 'wheel', 'touch', 'ground', 'boot', 'putting', 'weight', 'second', 'front', 'truck', 'tilted', 'much', 'veer', 'left', 'trying', 'go', 'straight', 'cushion', 'uneven', 'extremely', 'stiff', 'may', 'making', 'problem', 'worse', 'boot', 'nice', 'love', 'boot', 'however', 'shipping', 'skate', 'reflect', 'everything', 'besides', 'boot', 'literally', 'stuff', 'impala', 'c', 'skate', 'first', 'pair', 'price', 'took', 'skate', 'local', 'shop', 'try', 'replacing', 'cushion', 'fix', 'truck', 'issue', 'felt', 'like', 'completely', 'working', 'shop', 'owner', 'shocked', 'see', 'quality', 'plate', 'scuffed', 'look', 'like', 'already', 'used', 'year', 'troubleshooting', 'spending', 'extra', 'money', 'hopefully', 'fix', 'left', 'essentially', 'unskatable', 'skate', 'already', 'messaged', 'moonlightsupport', 'instagram', 'concerned', 'see', 'tried', 'change', 'shipping', 'address', 'order', 'week', 'ago', 'since', 'got', 'extended', 'moving', 'never', 'replied', 'terrified', 'going', 'leave', 'skate', 'want', 'use', 'anyone', 'tip', 'successfully', 'connecting']",142
3855,wear safety gear,Rollerskating,"Seriously! I am on my third day of skating and sitting here with a fully intact body instead of a broken head because I wore my helmet! It was raining outside but I still wanted to skate, so I tried skating in my garage. Still wore all my gear, and was mostly struggling with the slight slope of the ground. But that wasn’t even my downfall (pun intended)! I was trying to practice balancing on my toe stops and I guess was leaning too much on I think my right front wheels, and I suddenly fell fully spread out back on the ground. My head hit the ground hard, as did my butt, but luckily I didn’t break my tailbone and my helmet kept my head from splitting open. When I got over the shock of it and tried getting up, I fell again, almost the same way. Luckily I was closer to the ground the second time but both were so fast and unexpected that I couldn’t stop it or fall on my side. I seriously am grateful for my gear and am actually more confident now knowing that it keeps me safer. I still don’t want to fall and know I can get seriously injured even with gear (like I said, I’m grateful my tailbone didn’t fracture), but I’m a little less scared of falling now.

But seriously, WEAR YOUR GEAR!!! I keep seeing people (especially fellow newbies) on here practicing with no gear or only pads but no helmet. Pleaseeeeeee don’t do that! Invest in a good helmet and good pads/wrist guards (I probably would’ve scraped some skin off my wrists today too without my wrist guards!!). It’s not a hard thing to do and it’s so much safer than not being fully geared up!! I’m happy to have just a little headache and a tiny bit of leg pain as opposed to being in the hospital right now! WEAR IT!!!!!!

(Also, I tried skating still after falling for a few more minutes, but ultimately gave up because I was a bit shaken. I’ll stick to large fully flat surfaces for the time being to hopefully not repeat this mistake)",seriously third day skating sitting fully intact body instead broken head wore helmet raining outside still wanted skate tried skating garage still wore gear mostly struggling slight slope ground even downfall pun intended trying practice balancing toe stop guess leaning much think right front wheel suddenly fell fully spread back ground head hit ground hard butt luckily break tailbone helmet kept head splitting open got shock tried getting fell almost way luckily closer ground second time fast unexpected stop fall side seriously grateful gear actually confident knowing keep safer still want fall know get seriously injured even gear like said grateful tailbone fracture little le scared falling seriously wear gear keep seeing people especially fellow newbie practicing gear pad helmet pleaseeeeeee invest good helmet good pad wrist guard probably would scraped skin wrist today without wrist guard hard thing much safer fully geared happy little headache tiny bit leg pain opposed hospital right wear also tried skating still falling minute ultimately gave bit shaken stick large fully flat surface time hopefully repeat mistake,"['seriously', 'third', 'day', 'skating', 'sitting', 'fully', 'intact', 'body', 'instead', 'broken', 'head', 'wore', 'helmet', 'raining', 'outside', 'still', 'wanted', 'skate', 'tried', 'skating', 'garage', 'still', 'wore', 'gear', 'mostly', 'struggling', 'slight', 'slope', 'ground', 'even', 'downfall', 'pun', 'intended', 'trying', 'practice', 'balancing', 'toe', 'stop', 'guess', 'leaning', 'much', 'think', 'right', 'front', 'wheel', 'suddenly', 'fell', 'fully', 'spread', 'back', 'ground', 'head', 'hit', 'ground', 'hard', 'butt', 'luckily', 'break', 'tailbone', 'helmet', 'kept', 'head', 'splitting', 'open', 'got', 'shock', 'tried', 'getting', 'fell', 'almost', 'way', 'luckily', 'closer', 'ground', 'second', 'time', 'fast', 'unexpected', 'stop', 'fall', 'side', 'seriously', 'grateful', 'gear', 'actually', 'confident', 'knowing', 'keep', 'safer', 'still', 'want', 'fall', 'know', 'get', 'seriously', 'injured', 'even', 'gear', 'like', 'said', 'grateful', 'tailbone', 'fracture', 'little', 'le', 'scared', 'falling', 'seriously', 'wear', 'gear', 'keep', 'seeing', 'people', 'especially', 'fellow', 'newbie', 'practicing', 'gear', 'pad', 'helmet', 'pleaseeeeeee', 'invest', 'good', 'helmet', 'good', 'pad', 'wrist', 'guard', 'probably', 'would', 'scraped', 'skin', 'wrist', 'today', 'without', 'wrist', 'guard', 'hard', 'thing', 'much', 'safer', 'fully', 'geared', 'happy', 'little', 'headache', 'tiny', 'bit', 'leg', 'pain', 'opposed', 'hospital', 'right', 'wear', 'also', 'tried', 'skating', 'still', 'falling', 'minute', 'ultimately', 'gave', 'bit', 'shaken', 'stick', 'large', 'fully', 'flat', 'surface', 'time', 'hopefully', 'repeat', 'mistake']",173

I've had my impala skates for about five months and guess what, the heel is starting to rip... I purchased them through a certified seller (not impala directly) and the store said to send them back for ""assessment"" even though it is outside the 3 month warranty after a few emails. My mum is convinced that the ACCC (sorry this q for Australian folk)  will accept it as it is not fit for purpose, but I'm not sure if its worth the $30+ shipping to return (and for them to send back to me again if they dont accept :( - would they even do that??).

Or should I just keep skating on them until they my skates completely die. The splitting is pretty minimal atm and I could put the money directly to another pair of skates. I'd like to hear what you guys think! Either way I don't think I want to buy impala again.

I’m struggling on a few things and if someone could give advice on any of these I’d be very thankful:

-skating over those stupid yellow bumpy things on sidewalks

-actually doing a transition without picking up my foot

-stopping on a downhill/ going really fast

-honestly any other tips for a beginner

I’m a 16 year old and spent my entire first few paychecks from my minimum wage job to get these. So I’m not gonna waste my money. I’m going to put as much effort as I can in this hobby.

3895,moxi sizing woman shoe size,Rollerskating,"Hi everyone — i wanted to get your advice because I feel like I have conflicting info. 

Some facts:
- I’m an 8 in the moxi panther
- I’m really all over the place between 8.5 and 9 in regular shoes 
- I’m sometimes 39-41 in European sizes depending on the shoe, usually more 39-40
- my foot measures 9 and 7/8th inches - just under 10inches on both feet (with skater socks on)
-with this measurement, Riesell’s print out size chart recommends a 7, but I’m afraid this will be just a tiny bit small and the length won’t stretch obviously 
- here’s the official Riedell size chart for reference - https://www.roller.riedellskates.com/UserFiles/Documents/Riedell-Roller-Sizing-Guide_High-Top-Boots.pdf

Do I order an 8 or a 9 in moxi lolly? What have your experiences been with sizing?

3923,skate fit,Rollerskating,"Hello 👋 

Questions about skate fit! How do you like your skates to fit or what are your experiences with how your skates fit? 

Having previously done derby, the advice was always that your skates should fit like a second skin with the boot making quite a bit of contact with your foot to minimise blisters and foot cramp. 

I have pretty wide feet and have put in an order for a pair of moonlight rollers in a size down from my usual street shoe size. This makes me nervous because I usually size up in street shoes to accommodate for the wideness of my feet (with my shoes being quite roomy in the toe as a result). 

Hoping it’ll all be ok though and they’ll fit! 😬

Any comments/advice on MLR fit and break-in welcome too! 🙌",hello question skate fit like skate fit experience skate fit previously done derby advice always skate fit like second skin boot making quite bit contact foot minimise blister foot cramp pretty wide foot put order pair moonlight roller size usual street shoe size make nervous usually size street shoe accommodate wideness foot shoe quite roomy toe result hoping ok though fit comment advice mlr fit break welcome,"['hello', 'question', 'skate', 'fit', 'like', 'skate', 'fit', 'experience', 'skate', 'fit', 'previously', 'done', 'derby', 'advice', 'always', 'skate', 'fit', 'like', 'second', 'skin', 'boot', 'making', 'quite', 'bit', 'contact', 'foot', 'minimise', 'blister', 'foot', 'cramp', 'pretty', 'wide', 'foot', 'put', 'order', 'pair', 'moonlight', 'roller', 'size', 'usual', 'street', 'shoe', 'size', 'make', 'nervous', 'usually', 'size', 'street', 'shoe', 'accommodate', 'wideness', 'foot', 'shoe', 'quite', 'roomy', 'toe', 'result', 'hoping', 'ok', 'though', 'fit', 'comment', 'advice', 'mlr', 'fit', 'break', 'welcome']",67

Haven’t skated in them yet but plan to when the rain subsides on Seattle. The fit will be determined later but right now, I thought it wouldn’t fit but with the laces tightened, they fit fine. Wheels were a must to replace and I may change the toe stops later on (trying to cut back on my skating expenses). Happy November Skating!

can someone recommend good all weather purpose besrings for me?
Would you rather use stainless steel besrings or ceramic bearings?
Or would you just refrain from skating on wet trails at all?

We had an amazing summer but of course fall is wet as ever. So now I need a way to skate without the need to completely take apart my skates and clean bearings every single time I return home.

Or would you rather say I should just sit it out? Is there more to worry about than just rusting bearings?

Of course I would make sure to clean and dry off the boot, just taking apart the bearings every time is really tedious :)

(I repost this monthly because there are always some new folks who haven't seen it previously and say ""thanks"" for posting.  I apologize for the duplication to those who have seen it before.    
FYI, you can click on the ""Skate Tunes"" flair to see other postings with the same flair.)

BACKGROUND

Wednesday nights at my local rink are ""Retro Music nights"" (70s-80s to current). They use the same playlist almost every Wednesday night, which gets boring. Since I'm ""of that era"", to try to help them out I compiled a collection of Retro music that I felt would be good to skate to. I gradually built this collection over the past 2 years. Since each skate session is 2.5 hours long, I created 12 2.5 hour mixes to give them a different playlist (with no duplicates) every week for 3 months. 30 hours of music. I have skated through each playlist and found them very skateable.

I shared the collection with the rink manager several months ago, but they have not used it or changed their playlist. I spent many hours selecting &amp; editing the MP3s and arranging them into playlists. I didn't want the effort to go to waste so I copy the MP3s to USB sticks and share them with people who hopefully will enjoy them.

Since some people prefer streaming, I also created Spotify playlists for each mix to post here on Reddit. Some songs in the original mixes weren't available on Spotify so there are some substitutions, but it's 98% the same.

These Spotify playlist links are also posted in the r/rollerskating wiki, as are several other user-submitted skating playlist links.

MUSIC DESCRIPTION

Mostly 70s and 80s, with some older songs from the 50s and 60s, and also some newer songs from the 90s &amp; 2000s. Nothing ""current"", almost no rap/hip-hop.

Lots of classic rock, disco, pop, and some R&amp;B/Motown. Some acapella covers of hits from that era. 98% up-tempo, with a strong beat, good to skate to, with a few slower ""couples skate"" songs to catch your breath.

Whenever possible, I used ""High Quality"" or ""Remastered"" song versions for the best quality.

There are a few duplicates, with the original and a remixed/dance version, but always in different playlists.

Each RetroMix contains roughly 40 songs, with a diversity of songs, artists, and tempos in each mix without repeating artists or music styles consecutively.

The RetroMixes are basically in artist name order, with a few manual adjustments to ensure variety. Each RetroMix can be played as-is with no need to Shuffle.

I hope you enjoy these and look forward to your thoughts &amp; comments.

Some of the music is ""nontraditional"" skating music, but is good to skate to if you enjoy those types of music.

3964,learning impala,Rollerskating,"Hi everyone! I’m a newbie, however I’ve skated on and off as a kid into adult hood just casually with friends at roller rinks using whatever skates they provide there. I made the impulse decision a few weeks ago to purchase impalas, and of course did research on them while they were on their way here. I’ve been skating on them for a few weeks now, however, I seem to just be completely incapable of balancing on these impalas. Every day I go out is like a whole new day on these bad boys. The boot itself is soooo stiff and feels like I still haven’t broken them in.... still. The boot itself comes up so high past my ankle, and they’re unbelievably heavy... I was wondering if anyone else had this problem with Impalas? I never expected that I’d buy some of my own skates..... and then turns out that I suck at skating even though I’ve never had problems in the past LOL. Please also feel free to let me know your favorite skates you’ve owned, so I can do my research and look into replacing the impalas so I can finally get grooving!",hi everyone newbie however skated kid adult hood casually friend roller rink using whatever skate provide made impulse decision week ago purchase impala course research way skating week however seem completely incapable balancing impala every day go like whole new day bad boy boot soooo stiff feel like still broken still boot come high past ankle unbelievably heavy wondering anyone else problem impala never expected buy skate turn suck skating even though never problem past lol please also feel free let know favorite skate owned research look replacing impala finally get grooving,"['hi', 'everyone', 'newbie', 'however', 'skated', 'kid', 'adult', 'hood', 'casually', 'friend', 'roller', 'rink', 'using', 'whatever', 'skate', 'provide', 'made', 'impulse', 'decision', 'week', 'ago', 'purchase', 'impala', 'course', 'research', 'way', 'skating', 'week', 'however', 'seem', 'completely', 'incapable', 'balancing', 'impala', 'every', 'day', 'go', 'like', 'whole', 'new', 'day', 'bad', 'boy', 'boot', 'soooo', 'stiff', 'feel', 'like', 'still', 'broken', 'still', 'boot', 'come', 'high', 'past', 'ankle', 'unbelievably', 'heavy', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'else', 'problem', 'impala', 'never', 'expected', 'buy', 'skate', 'turn', 'suck', 'skating', 'even', 'though', 'never', 'problem', 'past', 'lol', 'please', 'also', 'feel', 'free', 'let', 'know', 'favorite', 'skate', 'owned', 'research', 'look', 'replacing', 'impala', 'finally', 'get', 'grooving']",92

I currently have moxi lollys in a size 6 and am looking to upgrade from the stock thrust plate. I’m obsessed with the pink Pilot falcon and contacted a skate shop about sizing but no luck with actually getting them (I live in Australia, everything’s sold out everywhere here). 

From the rec and research I’m looking at a 6.00 plate, but they’re sold out - so here’s my question:
My current plate is 236 mm long, the 6.00 Pilot plate recommended is 3mm longer than that, but I’m looking at a massive wait/ordering from the US to get one. I’ve found the plate in a 5.75, which is 5mm shorter than my current plate. It seems my plate is relatively between the two sizes, is going down 5mm going to make a huge difference ?? Should I wait it out or start looking for a different plate ?? gah 😔😔

3999,disappointing experience discountskatewear,Rollerskating,"Hey everyone! I wasn't really sure if I should even bring this up in the first place, but I thought others in the community might want to know about my experience.

Back in early July, I ordered a pair of skates through DiscountSkateWear after triple-checking that the skates I was looking at were in stock. 

I didn't hear anything for 10 days, so I emailed their sales team and promptly got a response from their CEO. She explained that the skate manufacturer builds their skates to order and that because of the rollerskating surge, there were massive delays (which is totally understandable) and offered me 2 options for custom skates. Right after that email though, she emailed me again to say that the skates I initally ordered were on their way to the store and that they'd be shipped out to me by next week.

But then after that... nothing. I never received any sort of shipping confirmation. I sent multiple follow-up emails asking about my order with no responses.

I finally sent another email last month asking for a cancellation and refund, then waited a week. When I didn't get a response again, I opened a case directly with PayPal... and got my money back by the next day.

This whole process has been pretty frustrating and annoying. I ended up getting a great pair of skates off of Ebay, but I'm still bummed that this happened, especially since I know other skaters here have had good experiences with DiscountSkateWear. Has anyone else had issues with them, or was I just unlucky?

TLDR: I ordered skates through DiscountSkateWear and essentially got ghosted by them after their initial response despite sending them multiple emails asking for updates about my order.

4039,legacy skate mlr order cancelled,Rollerskating,"Hi, y'all: 

Very new to the page, but just wanted to update anyone who ordered MLR from Legacy Skates + ask for some advice. 

So I got an email from Legacy Skates KC today. They decided to cancel their order w/ MLR. I'll attach a screenshot, but they were worried about receiving a quality product within a reasonable time frame. 

I understand that there have been a lot of issues with MLR lately, but it seemed to me like they were FINALLY getting their shit together. I really, \*really\* wanted to support MLR. Adrienne + the rest of her team seem so cool, and I was so excited about my first pair of skates to coming from a Black woman owned business.... I'm just kind of devastated right now. Maybe I can support them sometime in the future, assuming I stick with my skating! (if anyone has some size 7 mirrorballs... hmu) 

Again, in the screenshot, they're offering my an exchange for the new Chaya Melrose Elites in Sherbet Lime or Dusty Rose, some Beach Bunnies, OR a refund. Any advice on what I should do? I'm coming home for winter break in a few weeks and I was really looking forward to having all my skate gear there + ready to go before it got too cold.  

Do I do the exchange, or should I refund? I really wanted a suede boot with some ankle SUPPORT, which is one of the many reasons I wanted some MLR boots.  

 I'm sort of leaning towards a refund. I could try to go for the Moxi drop Fritzy's is having soon, or I could call Bruised Boutique and see what they have in stock? I could also wait on Derby Warehouse, OR hunt down some reidells or suregrips (I know they're a bit stiffer than the Moxi Lolly). 

Any advice from some more experienced skaters is much appreciated ! &lt;3 thanks!

4052,yet another sure grip boardwalk boot sizing question,Rollerskating,"So, I’ve decided to get SG 1300 boots or a pair of Boardwalks (and swapping the plates) as my upgrades skates for my birthday. 

Buuuut since I’m gonna have to order them from the USA (I’m in the UK) I really don’t want to have to return them because they’re the wrong size. 

I am a size 39-39.5/ UK 6. 

All my Vans shoes states I’m a USA M7 and W8.5. They also say that it’s 25cm. 

But both my Adidas pairs state I’m a US M6.5

My right foot is 25cm and my left is 25.2, which *of course* falls between the size 6 (24.7) and size 7 (25.4). The thing is, my present pair of skates (vinyl boot) were already slightly too big when I got them, and now that they’re broken in, I definitely have too much space, which hinders progress and throws off my balance. 

I have added the R-fit insole to help, which is a great insole that I would like to add to my new skates. And I wear thin/normal socks when skating. 

My thinking is that, as the Boardwalk/1300 boots are suede, they should break in and adapt to my feet, so maybe I should go for the size 6, but I want to know about everyone’s experience with them and how they broke in. (If you can give your feet size in cm, it would be really helpful! 😊)

I ordered some beach bunnies size 6 and they felt really tight at first in the toes and balls of my feet and it scared me really badly.

Out of curiosity I started doing more research on the fit of beach bunnies, and was able to relace the 6’s and they fit better width wise. 
My toes aren’t curled or crushed but they are uncomfortable touching the top, but I’m worried if I try the 7’s they’ll be too big. But from what I saw you want the beach bunnies to be snug on every part of your foot like a sock. Is this correct?? Does it ever get any better? 
I want to send back one of them, or maybe resell the one who doesn’t fit to someone who wants them urgently. I just want to skate until my 7’s come in to see if these are bearable, but if I go outside I won’t be able to send these back to the company I bought them from.

4239,help choose upgrade skate,Rollerskating,"Hey skaters,

So I got skates late June and started the 365 Daily Skate early August (today is day 87).  I feel like I have progressed relatively quickly, and am ready to start looking for my next skate.  I told myself I'd be able to upgrade at the 6 month mark, which puts me at about February.  Works out well since nothing is in stock anyway.  Since I've got time to save for these, I don't really have a budget set, but I'd probably want to max it out around $650.  Spending less is totally fine, it doesn't have to be the creme de la creme.  

Currently skating on Jackson Finesse with Radar wheels, so a solid entry level skate.  These have served me well, and have held up great, but are a bit big (I did get sized at a skate shop, but they are slightly large).

I kind of had my heart set on Clementine Lollies for my 6 Months Skate, but I'm not wild about the new color so I'm a bit at a loss as to what to do.  Part of me doesn't want to spend $300 on a mid-range skate if I'm just going to want to upgrade into the $500+ range in a year.  I'm in it for the long haul and at this point am not worried I may lose interest; I'm *obsessed* with roller skating.  

**My main wants:**

* suede boot
* I'd prefer a leather sole, but it's not a dealbreaker.  This is just me being bougie.  
* upgrade to a higher end metal plate, as I want to eventually park skate safely.  SureGrip Avanti Mag or Reactor Neo/Pro.  Would love to hear your thoughts on these.

**Skates I've considered:**

* Riedell 336 (I'd have to ColorLab it to get suede) -- these are likely at the very highest end of my budget, and I wonder if this isn't overkill.  
* Moxi Lolly (At this point unless I can find old Clems, I think I'd do Pineapple.  Also I'd have to upgrade plates obviously -- Reactor Neo or Pro I guess)
* Moxi Jack (either custom or maybe just black suede w/ Reactor Neo/Pro)   
* Riedell Zone (Tan) w/ upgraded plate
* Boardwalks in a Park set up.

4249,ramp street wheel deal,Rollerskating," Hey sk8 m8s,

I see most manufacturers of park wheels offer two kinds - ramp and street, the street wheel usually having an ever-so-slightly lower durometer. In these contexts, street doesn't mean outdoor, but is said to be designed for 'street parks' (Idk what that even means) or parks that have concrete surfaces (that's every park, right?). 

One example is the the CIB wheels (pictured), with a ramp wheel that is 101a and the street wheel is 98a (and 3mm smaller). 

Another example is the Bont flow wheels, where the park wheel is 99a and the street wheel is 89a (but both are still park wheels).

I'm not worried about getting the ""wrong wheel"", but I wish I understood what these differences are for and what it all means in the context of park skating. Can anyone help? &lt;3",hey sk see manufacturer park wheel offer two kind ramp street street wheel usually ever slightly lower durometer context street mean outdoor said designed street park idk even mean park concrete surface every park right one example cib wheel pictured ramp wheel street wheel mm smaller another example bont flow wheel park wheel street wheel still park wheel worried getting wrong wheel wish understood difference mean context park skating anyone help lt,"['hey', 'sk', 'see', 'manufacturer', 'park', 'wheel', 'offer', 'two', 'kind', 'ramp', 'street', 'street', 'wheel', 'usually', 'ever', 'slightly', 'lower', 'durometer', 'context', 'street', 'mean', 'outdoor', 'said', 'designed', 'street', 'park', 'idk', 'even', 'mean', 'park', 'concrete', 'surface', 'every', 'park', 'right', 'one', 'example', 'cib', 'wheel', 'pictured', 'ramp', 'wheel', 'street', 'wheel', 'mm', 'smaller', 'another', 'example', 'bont', 'flow', 'wheel', 'park', 'wheel', 'street', 'wheel', 'still', 'park', 'wheel', 'worried', 'getting', 'wrong', 'wheel', 'wish', 'understood', 'difference', 'mean', 'context', 'park', 'skating', 'anyone', 'help', 'lt']",72

Should I send them back and potentially have to wait literal months to get the next size up (I’ve noticed size 7’s sell out first everywhere and nowhere I’ve checked has stock right now)?

i had already planned to use sneekrskates plates with sneakers but seeing some people riding quad plates with aggressive inline boots gave me an idea : maybe,  m a y b e  it might be possible to put sneekrskates AND inline soul plates together to make some nasty slides. but since i can't physically see if the parts fit together ad it would suck if i had to order many soul plates before finding the right pair, i'm asking for anyone's advice on it before making my move.

if you've got any experience with this or if you've made it work yourself, feel free to give as much details as possible.

I've been skating for about half a year now and made a ton of progress (practice does indeed make progress haha) so I wanted to start going to the skatepark.

The first pair of skates I got are the rio roller rio360 and I didnt put a lot of thought into buying these as they were affordable and available.

But now I want to get a really good pair of skates that I can use for outdoor skating and going to the skatepark without having to worry about them breaking or not giving me enough ankle support.

I'm thinking about getting the moxi panthers but I'm not sure if they are a good choice for the park, can anyone who has them give me their thoughts about whether or not they are good skate park skates?

Recommendations for other trusty skate park/outdoor skates are also very welcome :)

I know I have a right to be mad but I feel like Moxi as a company doesn't even care to make sure it has a returning customer base who would recommend them.

Lol.... so please see the link above for reference. I’m here to tell you to CANCEL YOUR ORDER IF YOU HAVEN’T ALREADY FOR MOXIS AT URBAN OUTFITTERS. 

Timeline for me:

- Ordered in May (promised delivery on June 28th)
- Next email update was not till mid-July saying it would be delivered by July 28th
- Another email a few days after July 28th saying shipping is delayed until Sept. 28th
- after 6 times through out the time line attempting to cancel; they finally officially cancelled the order after removing authorization of my payment method -___- around Sept. 24th (I advise you to do this to expedite things)

4349,skate park antik ar,Rollerskating,"Hey all,

I am after some advice for park skating, I have AR1's that I bought for roller derby (with ATOM Savant Poison wheels) and trail skating (with ATOM Pulse wheels) but since the lack of heel in the AR1's seem to make it harder to do a lot of recreational ""dancey"" type tricks I took them to the skatepark as a challenge which did not go well. I tried to plate stall but ended up on my butt/back. So clearly I am not a natural, I am too scared/cautious to fully commit to doing tricks.

My question is if I plan on improving my park skating should I get different wheels and grind blocks? Moxi fundaes seem to have a good rep but I am open to any suggestions! Or are Savant Poison's suitable for the park and I can wait until I get the feel of ramps a bit better and wait to request grind blocks as a Christmas present?

After talking with a few girls who did derby at my rink who didn’t know how I was even managing on my fundaes, I decided to get some rollerbones teams with 101a hardness.

I’m worried I may have overshot it—it wasn’t until my wheels came in that I realized that most people I saw online for 98a as their indoor wheel, with 101a being for more speed/sporty skating. I went once in the rink in my new wheels—and while it was fun/nice to be going faster/have more slide, I had a few collisions because I wasn’t used to the new speed and once or twice I tripped over my own feet. At one point I’m pretty sure one of my skates slipped (not rolled, like slipped sideways) out from under me.

4358,anyone started cheap pair skate upgraded found much easier learn,Rollerskating,"     So for some background I used the roller derby brand roller star 600 skate (a literally $45 skate) which looking back I'd say was comparable to a toy skate that ran in adult sizes. We're talking all plastic hardware and bearings so poor I had to keep my wheels audibly loose just to roll more than 6 feet with each stride. I used those for about 4 or 5 months before seeing them for the crap they really were and purchased some moxi beach bunnies at the very beginning of September (and I'm still waiting on them *sigh*). In the mean time I upgraded slightly to the skate gear brand sparkle skates ($70) and could already tell with the first use after changing the bearings that they were easier to use and I would improve much faster. 
     Unfortunately, the boot started to separate from the heel within a month and a half of use but I was luckily able to send them back to Amazon for a refund. Now I was without any skates until I found an old vintage suede pair online that didn't have any brand other than ""chicago"" on the very heavy plate and after some cleaning up the first time I used them was like magic. I could now suddenly carve effortlessly, had much more control and balance than I had with my other pair despite the trucks even being just a bit wonky (think a less-used pair of rental skates).
      Now its got me wondering if others who started on cheap skates (curious of the brand) have had a similar experience?

4377,skating birthday kit gf,Rollerskating,"Howdy!

I have skated a few times but always rented so I don't know too much about owning a pair. My GF's 27th birthday is coming up and I was wanting to get her a kit. She already has two pairs, indoor and outdoor. I just ordered a bag to transport her skates (she still uses the box they came in), but I was wondering if there are some other things I can put in the bag that would be useful? I peeked in the box and there's nothing else but the skate.

My background is more longboards, skateboards, swimming, and distance cycling so I don't really know what a typical EDC would look like for your (pretty awesome) community.. wheel lube, tools, extra wheels for different terrain, first aid kit?

4389,people skate van skatepark share experience first week moth skating,Rollerskating,"Hello,

I am working on getting the material ready for building Vans skate. I want to mount Sunlite plate on them and Penny trucks.

I skated on flat heeled skates before but I know that Vans are flatter than the flattest skate boots. 

And I see a lot of posts of people saying how it's dangerous and that you tend to fall backwards etc.

I had moxi lollys for 6 months so I'm used to very little ankle support and it doesn't bother me, what I am more concerned is the heel.

Can people who skate in Vans in skatepark share their experience of their first weeks or moths of skating in them? How longs was the transition period?

4394,disappointed moonlight roller,Rollerskating,"I'm confused and sad because I really wanted to support this company. It's black and woman owned and their boots are super cute and SUPER comfy. But I feel they've been straight up lying and NOT getting the (well deserved) flack that Moxi has been getting. They told everyone it would be a 4-6 week wait for skates from Aug 24th - and that's way past now. It's not 20 weeks, but it's still lying and unrealistic. Not to mention that wasn't stated anywhere on their website. I'm confused why everyone says Moonlight has been so communicative with their customers while Moxi has not been - I feel like they have both been lying a decent amount, but at least with Moxi it seems like they're lying because they're being way overly optimistic about how quickly they can get things done.

Adrienne said in a live (unsaved of course) while back that none of the skates were delayed long and they've all arrived at the warehouse - just to say that MORE skates have been held up at customs? It's starting to feel like she doesn't save her lives because she's afraid people will go back and cross reference them, lol. Not to mention a TON of other things - no transparency about the Safety Dances not being fulfilled, barely any emails, lying about where the skates are made, having random ""I know the owner!"" people responding to people's questions on IG... The list goes on, but it feels like if you try to criticize this company, people will flame you. I don't know.

I got my SD's a few days ago and I put them on and immediately just felt... Disappointed. Like... It was fine, decent I guess, just not what I was expecting from a boot that is only $20 away from the price of Lollys. Just, clack clack and cheapy feeling.

4428,moxi beach bunny,Rollerskating,"Hi everyone! 

So I fell into the rollerskating hype just like the entire world did and have had the most failed journey towards finding skates. 

First I got the Impala skates when they restocked earlier this month. I ended up cancelling the order a few hours later because I read they were terrible quality so I decided to try the impala inline skates. After I got them, I read that the company was unethical and they didnt fit me, so now I have to return these and actually pay to have them shipped back to the company :/

THEN I got the C7 skates and read that they were drop shipped so now I have to return those because it was wayyyy too much money for them to not at least, last.

I found some of the Moxi beach bunnies in stock that I read lots of positive things about but before I purchase, I wanna make sure these are the right choice and I won't have to make another trip to the post office.....pls help. Are these actually good skates or is it another one of those skates that have the hype but not the quality? I am a total beginner.

""Hello from Moonlight Roller!

We wanted to take a moment to update our customers on the status of their Moon Boots and thank you for your continued patience and support.

Our team is currently working diligently to fulfill outstanding orders. Due to the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, we have experienced countless shipping delays from the West Coast. This has resulted in delays being passed down to our customers. While we initially thought we would be able to have all orders out by the end of October, we’re now seeing that timeframe is unrealistic.

If you’re still waiting for your Moon Boots, you can expect your order in the next 2-3 weeks. If you no longer want to wait anymore, we will be allowing free cancellation for any customer regardless of reasoning.

In order to be respectful of the customers still waiting for their skates, we have decided to remove all standing stock from the website until we’re fully caught up.

From the bottom of our hearts, we apologize for the inconveniences these delays have caused. We never thought it would be possible to experience so much growth in less than a year’s time and will continue to do our best to deliver the best possible product to our customers.

Peace &amp; roller skates,

4494,need advice getting first ever pair,Rollerskating,"So, I'm 13 and during quarantine I was struck with the sudden urge to learn how to skate both on a board and on proper rollerskates. I recently found out that a local sports shop (Decathlon) was selling some and of course, I was excited and saved up. Now comes the real challenge of what in the actual frick do I need to know before getting them?


For reference, I'm around a size 5 1/2- 6, and I know it depends of preference but I'm curious about things like how small is too small//how big is too big, how do I know if the shoes are actually doing more bad than good to my feet, et cetera et cetera. I'm a bit iffy about the online reviews of the product but it is mostly positive. From what I've gathered, I just need the shoes themselves, protective gear, and some confidence or something. I'm super into the idea of learning something new before the year ends, so I'm willing to go try anything.

Any relevant advice would be gladly appreciated :))",quarantine struck sudden urge learn skate board proper rollerskates recently found local sport shop decathlon selling course excited saved come real challenge actual frick need know getting reference around size know depends preference curious thing like small small big big know shoe actually bad good foot et cetera et cetera bit iffy online review product mostly positive gathered need shoe protective gear confidence something super idea learning something new year end willing go try anything relevant advice would gladly appreciated,"['quarantine', 'struck', 'sudden', 'urge', 'learn', 'skate', 'board', 'proper', 'rollerskates', 'recently', 'found', 'local', 'sport', 'shop', 'decathlon', 'selling', 'course', 'excited', 'saved', 'come', 'real', 'challenge', 'actual', 'frick', 'need', 'know', 'getting', 'reference', 'around', 'size', 'know', 'depends', 'preference', 'curious', 'thing', 'like', 'small', 'small', 'big', 'big', 'know', 'shoe', 'actually', 'bad', 'good', 'foot', 'et', 'cetera', 'et', 'cetera', 'bit', 'iffy', 'online', 'review', 'product', 'mostly', 'positive', 'gathered', 'need', 'shoe', 'protective', 'gear', 'confidence', 'something', 'super', 'idea', 'learning', 'something', 'new', 'year', 'end', 'willing', 'go', 'try', 'anything', 'relevant', 'advice', 'would', 'gladly', 'appreciated']",80
