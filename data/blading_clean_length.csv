It would be great and highly appreciated, if someone could recommend me good skates based on details below.

1. Price tag ideally around 200€ (better under this amount, but I can be flexible with it).
2. My foot size is usually around 42-43EU (\~9 in UK or \~9.5 in US), max foot length is \~27.1cm, max foot width is \~11cm.
3. I am located in Europe, Slovakia. I have no problem to order from EU shops.
4. I am considering getting into some freestyle tricks (the simpler ones for now), but not the aggressive ones.
5. Last thing I am looking at in the future is probably the urge to try bigger wheels, so if the skates had changeable chassis, the better. This point is not mandatory though.

My consideration skates are Powerslide Next Core 80 (slightly above 200€) or Seba FRX 80.

Do you guys have any other recommendation or anything to add up? Are my consideration skates a good choice?

3,european skater answering true calling looking tip best buy beginner aggressive skate,rollerblading,"Hi everyone!

Long story short, back when I was a wee little boy - going on 32 now - I really wanted to get into aggressive blading. Unfortunately, a succession of ingrown toenails and even surgery had me abandon the dream, because the tight fit of rollerblades were really painful for me. I got into skateboarding instead.

Cut to twenty years later, and I see these kids blading in the park, enjoying themselves so much, and it got me thinking... I should give it another shot! My feet are fine now, so I should be able to support the boots.

So I come to you, because I'm really not in touch at all anymore with rollerblading gear, and I'm looking for beginner aggressive skates that are:

* comfortable for large feet (size 12 and flatfoot)
* lightweight
* fit for grinding, stunts and cruising
* not too expensive

Hopefully you can help me out!

I don’t want to spend too much (&lt;$150 ideally ) to see if I want to get into it. I really like the three wheel designs I have been seeing. Is that considered advanced or much harder than 4 wheels? I’m confident I could ride them, and I’m interested so I can ride the local trail and get some nice speed on the workout. 

Background I guess: 
I used to skate when I was younger, and was decent but nothing crazy. I had some K2’s and would go to the skate park, etc until about the age of 12. 26 now, so it’s been a while. Generally I’m very coordinated and athletic. 

I was also hoping for possibly a couple of recommendations, here are two that I have been looking at. First one does not release until March and the second one I really liked for the price point but it looks very ugly.

62,help fr skate fitment,rollerblading,"I posted another topic recently about issue I've been having with my FR skates, and they just seem to keep coming.  


I was getting blisters on the inside of my feet on both skates, I purchased Superfeet Carbon Hockey Pro insoles to remedy this as they offer way more arch support than the stock insoles and because I thought I was pronating too much, causing the friction chafing. These didn't help at all, so I purchased some MyFit Footies which thankfully eliminated the issue and stopped the rubbing altogther, but on my first session using the Footies I started getting cramp in the arches of both feet straight away at the beginning of my session. I kept skating and eventually went away, but I can't help but think that it's normal for people to be comfortable in their skates!

Since purchasing the skate I have since learnt that FR Skates are wide fit, and my feet are normal (narrow?). I'm now considering new insoles, would this be the right move? For the money I'll end up spending on the FR3 I may as well have bought a more expensive skate!

101,socialize dog sound rollerblade,rollerblading,"So I was on a park connector/path next to a canal with my 3x110s and this unleashed dog (think it was an airedale terrier) took off with me to the consternation of the owners for a good 300m. I saw it sniffing the grass when I passed them but had no idea it was behind me until I had to slow down for a traffic light ahead cos of my earbuds. I'm masked up too because of wuhanvirus when I skate and that just creates more breathing noises while the earbuds are in so I literally can't hear anything below supercar or F15 engines. It was just barking at my skates but wasn't really aggressive or anything and seemed happy to chase the sound that the wheels were making on the rough pavement. 

I eventually had to stop it from running out onto the road by stopping and holding up my hands at its head level to try and block the way. That's where I got the sense it wasn't aggressive as it didn't try to bite and I think it stopped barking once the skates went silent. One of the owners came running up soon after thankfully. 

My question is: how do you train dogs to treat the gnashing of your skate wheels as normal and not chase the skater? Skate while walking the dog? I've had a few dogs start going crazy when they hear the skates and it'd be nice to give the owners some tips for socializing their furry friends.

Part of it is that when I start to get tried my form starts to suffer, and I start to slow down and work less, so I don't go further. On top of that skating with poor form is far more detrimental on then in shoes, so I seem to just do the same distance every time.

150,choosing right skate semi newbie,rollerblading,"I've been skating since I was in elementary school and I've only taken up rollerblading in the past few years. I've been using a pair of hand me down inline hockey skates from the 90s. They're pretty shot. I'm planning a trip this summer that incorporates multiple short-ish commutes. I want to try rollerblading them. However, since I've never actually bought a pair of skates I'm in need of advice. 

I want a pair that are versatile enough for skating in the city and on rough (paved with some gravel) country roads.

What I've been considering:

**Skates:** FR3 310 or FR SPIN 310

**Wheels:** Atom Boom Magic 100mm-110mm XFirm

**Bearings:** BankRoll Ceramics

&amp;#x200B;

Some places I'll be skating:

San Fran

New Orleans

Numerous locations in Arizona urban and rural

Pittsburgh

New York City

Virginia rural and urban

Thanks for the help!

154,help new aeon painfully tight,rollerblading,"So, my new USD Aeon 60 Basics arrived today. I unfortunately broke the cuff of my size 12 Solomon ST-ONEs (yes, they are very old skates).

I normally wear size 11W shoes, and I had to size up the Solomon’s for comfort.

With the Aeons, the size was “11-12” which was quite confusing. I read that they run small so I wanted to size up, but I wasn’t sure if they run small for 11s or small 12s. Anyhow, it didn’t matter because the size “11-12” skate was the largest size offered.

They are excruciatingly tight.

I took out the liner and tried on the boot by itself and there was plenty of room, so I guess the tightness is coming primarily from the liner.

I need advice from someone who is knowledgeable about this situation. I’ve considered several options. What should I do? 

1) Just deal with it, they will eventually break in.

2) Try heat molding them to better fit my foot.

3) Purchase new liners that are a bit thinner

4) Return them and go with a different model skate.

The challenge is that once I skate them, I can’t return them. Returning them is my least favorite option as I am really excited about these skates, but if that is the best option I need to make that call now. I wish I could actually skate them outside for a couple hours to get a feel for them.

193,need help finding right skate,rollerblading,"Hello people of r/rollerblading,

Because of this global pandemic I too have decided to start skating. I haven't skated all that much before, but I'm a pretty good iceskater. When I was very young I skated a little bit on 4 wheel skates, but after that I pretty much only skated on ice.
Now I'm looking at skates, but there's so many options that I'm kinda overwhelmed, and I can't go into a store either because of the lockdown

I'm 186 cm and weigh roughly 65 kilos. I have size 45-46 EU though my feet are quite big. I want skates that do well in both an urban and rural environment. Being able to do little jumps but also skate for long distances. My budget is around 200-250 euros.

What would you guys recommend for someone like me? I was looking at the Powerslide Next Core 100 but saw quite a few people online state that 110s are better. Or should I just go for 4 wheel skates? I'm kinda clueless at this point haha.

211,way tie lace,rollerblading,"Hi everyone, I'm another recent returner to skates from the nineties. This sub has been a great resource for me to learn the basics of blading that I never figured out as a kid, so thanks!

 I have seen several posts of people on here asking for advice on how to lace up their boots, and I just stumbled across this website that features 60+ different ways to tie shoelaces while searching for new laces. Some ways use up extra length of laces, some are fast to loosen or fast to tighten, some are supposed to relieve pressure on certain parts of the feet and some are just decorative, but I am so entertained, I thought I should share for the next person who is searching. Check out [Ian's Shoelace Site](https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/).

I haven't found a style of lacing specifically for inline skates, but here's a great photo from the site:

*Processing img 6rprw1zmmzh61...*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gonna try some of the fast lacing methods on here so next time I get stuck in the bowl at the skate park I can get out faster. I'm not good at pumping yet, and last time I was there I spent about 45 minutes in there trying to figure it out, but then someone else showed up and I had to take off my skates and climb out to get out of their way.

With the new skates, i want to commute and do fast urban skating, but also try some tricks, which I'm not able to with my current skates. I'd say 75% fast urban and 25% tricks. maybe 80/20.

My idea is to go with either 90mm or 100mm for the wheel size to keep the speed of my current setup, but with a slight rocker to be more nimble. So Endless 90/100 or NN 90/100 with a v-rocker. Now the question is, which one to get?

247,around skate jack ace none,rollerblading,"Hello all,

While I'm note exactly new to inline skates, I'm certainly not at all up to speed on them either.  I'm looking at getting back into inline skates and need a little guidance.

My wife wanted some skates for Christmas and I was happy to oblige.  Got her some Impala skates which she seems pretty happy with as a new skater.  I want to be able to skate with her.

I on the other hand am having a much more difficult time finding something that seems appropriate for me.  I'm not a speed skater or an aggressive skater, but I do like the freedom of a little bit more speed and being able to hit a skate park just to cruise through.  After looking at different brands and models, it seems like I should be looking at a more urban boot.  Something with moderate speed but ample control.  I'm also an American and it seems like my options are limited not only with brands that I can easily find, but sizing as well.  (I've noticed the Europeans have more websites dedicated to this).

With that being the case, it seems like my best option might be a Rollerblade Twister Edge, but I've heard they're kind of slim and my foot is a little more on the wider side.  The Maxxum model also doesn't seem to go higher than a 10 (i'm 11-12 depending on brand)  I see Seba is big on here, but I'm having a hell of a time finding some in my size that aren't way more than I'm looking to spend (really I don't want to spend more that $300, $250 if possible).  I'd prefer 4W over 3W but I suppose beggars can't be choosers and I'm open to other options.

297,new skating supine stance,rollerblading,"Hello! New to inline skating and I have questions about my stance being extremely supine. I'd done a lot of research about skate types and fitting, and I suspected this may be an issue.

TLDR: Is an extreme supine ""normal"" for some people, or do I just have the wrong body type or foot posture for inline skating?  Would switching to the full boot type skates make that much of a difference? Can being able to laterally adjust the Twister be a total game-changer, or is this a problem beyond being able to adjust the skates?  Is the height of the 90's making that big of a difference?

Some background first that may help an answer/suggestion. My kids started inline skating, and I was hoping to join them to supplement our biking at the parks, which are long bike paths made of asphalt. I'm shorter and on the heavy side at a bit over 200 lbs.  As a result, I was concerned about how much support a skate would provide. I skated some when I was younger on cheap rec skates and I remember having the same problem then with supination. I do tend to show wear on the outside heel of my shoes, so I'm guessing this may be my natural posture.

The few skates I was contemplating are the RB Macdroblade 90's, the RB  Maxxum Edge 90's, or the RB Twister Edge 80's. Since I can return them unused, I planned to purchase them, try them on, on the carpet at home (but not skate them), and keep the pair that seems to feel the best. The reason I considered the models above was because they are all supposed to be very supportive, including the most Rec skate of the bunch, the Macroblade 90. 

Ok, so the Macroblade 90's arrived today, and according to all my research, the boot fits very well, no movement at the heal and my toes do not touch the toe of the boot.  
However, when I stand at a natural stance, around shoulder-width apart my feet naturally supine, an extreme amount. For my feet to be at a normal stance, I had to squeeze my knees together an extreme amount. I experimented with a staggered stance, bent knees, T-stance, V-stance, and no matter how I postured I had this extreme supine. My feet just want to flop to the outside. The wheels will not stay under my foot, so my full weight is on my ankle joint. I spent 15 minutes standing in them and I have pain in my shin muscle from the stretch it created, and my ankle joint hurts. I could never skate like that, as when I would glide my entire body weight would be on my ankle joint. 

Would changing to the full boot type skates make that much of a difference? Can being able to laterally adjust the Twister be a total game-changer, or is this a problem beyond being able to adjust the skates?  Is the height of the 90's making that big of a difference?

Im one of those folks that sit in between Small and Medium THEM skates. Literally in between.

Currently using the small shell THEM 909 with the danny beer intuition 26-26.5cm. Still breaking them in pretty tight for might right foot but ive got some help from people here that it will eventually break in and feel the best. The left foot already feels perfect. 

So onto the Razors Shifts, i just want another skate to switch around with, possibly use with my  GC 80mm HD frames and cruise. Ive seen some conflicting info online on the sizing... something about razors changing the shell size years ago. So based on google search and on here. Based on my foot size i am a Razors Shift Shell size 6/7 at 272mm. Is this accurate? Anyone with the same 27cm(270mm) foot ride a 6/7 comfortably?

310,advice getting skate,rollerblading,"Hi, I'm looking to get into inline skating, and am pretty much a beginner, I've spent a couple of hours on skates. 

So far my top choice is the Flying Eagle F6s Falcon, based on sizing and price (and style). It looks to me like size 8 will work, my foot is 26.2cm long and 9.4cm wide, which seems like an average width, compatible with these skates from what I've read. 

The problem with the F6s is I can't find a heel brake in stock anywhere for these, and only ProSkatersPlace has the green in stock, which I prefer, but  haven't heard the most favorable reviews of the shop. Inline Warehouse has them in red, which I am okay with, if the buying experience from IW is that much better. So my question is, should I wait until the heel brake is in stock (Mar. 18th, which is longer than I want to wait), Try to learn without the brake, or should I go with a different skate entirely?

I'm considering the Imperial One 80s, RB80s, and Powerslide zoom 80s as well. (Seba FRX looks to be too wide, and Twister Edge skates are out of my price range)

321,updated setup seba fr fr liner endless hydrogen mm marathon,rollerblading,"First of all, this is not a repost of u/nicktodorov´s yesterday's post, it's just an HUGE coincidence :D

&amp;#x200B;

So, after some months enjoying the Endless 80 with 84mm wheels, that I though was a big upgrade over the previous frames I had (SEBA FR4 FR FRX 310), and despite thinking they're better for certain kinds of skating (slalom/dancing, park, jumping), the fact is nowadays I'm pretty much focused in learning flatland/wizard tricks.

Thing is, my boot is EUR 42, and that meant Endless 84 was not long enough. So two weeks ago I was fortunate to be able to see my black Endless 80s to a girl in Barcelona, while I bought silver Endless 90s from u/TylerWInTic , without loosing any money.

At the same time I bought the Berlin Marathon edition of Hydrogen 90mm wheels, from Der-roller.

Yesterday the frames arrived, and I already took them for a spin, and I couldn't be more happy: if Endless 80 were a step up, the 90s are another level: speed, stability, and huge agility at the same time. And I can't feel the extra weight nor did clip my skates a single time while doing crossovers.

Now I've just have to get some 110s to test the 3\*3 setup (only have 100s)

Well, I've been rollerblading for some time now with quite old fitness skates and they just don't feel right anymore and I think it's time to get something proper. The candidates right now are the FR1 90 and the Twister Edge. I've been using 4x80, which is nice, but I think I want to go bigger.

This means that I would have to replace the frame and wheels of the Twister Edge, which would bring it right to my budget of 350€. I've mainly been commuting and skating fast, but without any tricks since the skates just felt too unstable for that. Commuting and being fast will remain the main focus point, but I do want to be able to do some stuff when I want to. My feet are size 42.5 and they have a normal width (\~10cm)

I also took the Powerslide Next into consideration, but while it if of course nice that the ride height is lower, I really don't like the propriety frame design, since I want to be able to upgrade to an Endless or NN at some point.

New to seba blades, ive tried on Seba CJ2 before and i know heel spacing is wide. But other than that not much. 

My seba highlights just came in (40EU, 26cm) 

The sizing felt less tight than i expected it to be, almost feel like a 39 would of suffice... 
reason why i think its not tight or fitting that i expected or desired:

- my toes doesnt hit the tip of the boot (not as much as a big deal but is there solution? )

- seba heels are wide, and it feels loss that my ankles feel like their taking alot of sprain.  (Any solution to the extra spacing?) 

- the lacing system seems confusing and found the buckles to get in the way of it (does anyone have a good method of lacing their their boot and when they wear it?)

- how should i cut the excess buckle for a good fit? 

- has anyone gutted their seba HL and inserted intuitions? (For near future)

Following this logic, if I want to turn right, I would lead with my right foot, kickturn right, and land with my right foot in front. 

I'd like to think of this as more of an inside-out kickturn, but there's one problem: I can't do this because it requires a proficient level of ambidexterity. 

Then I have seen people that go up quarters with their right foot leading, kickturning left, and landing right foot in front. 
This is more of an outside-in approach that is also ambidextrous if followed religiously, but that is also a quite a problem. 

Then there's the natural approach, where you have a dominant foot in front at all times. The problem I have with this is that doesn't it inhibit you to turn in both directions?

372,would kindly help find new boot weird wide foot tracing foot first comment,rollerblading,"a bit of history. i did a fair amount of aggressive skating from around 1995 to 2001 or so, aged 13-19. i remember salomons being my favorite and most comfortable from back then, i also liked the original 5th elements, but i skated so many kinds i cant even remember them all. was never really that good and ended up just quitting for various reasons. 

i picked it back up very briefly around 2014, age 31, only lasted a year or two. once again, i tried aggressive but im just not very good at it, i did discover how much i love just rolling around and cruising though.

during that time in 2014/2015 i tried a lot of different skates, these were not good fits:
all are US sizing
size 9 usd thrones, waaay too skinny, even bare shells without liners. 
size 9 razors sl’s, width was good on these but they were very bulky and had some extra room lengthwise i didnt like. 
size 9 rb solo’s, cant remember how the length was but too skinny again. 
size 10 usd carbon 2’s, width was good but length was just too long. 
size 9 original run seba cj’s, i remember them being EXTREMELY comfortable, but in an old post on facebook i said i kept stubbing my toes so i guess they were just a tiny bit too small. i remember the width and comfort of these were PERFECT though. 


the only ones i remember fully liking, and not really sure why i sold them, was a pair of size 9 usd carbon 3’s that i peeled some of the skin/liner back from the toes, and cut the carbon out from the toe area with a dremel. 

so here i am again, looking for new boots to cruise around in, maybe some super basic skate park aggressive stuff here and there. i remember really liking the fit of the carbon 3’s that i cut the toes out of. i’ll do it again if i absolutely have to, but it was a huge pain and i would like to just buy something that fits if possible. 

i will mainly be using some k2 r100 frames that i picked up. i prefer flat boots, not the biggest fan of raised heel style boots. 

im looking at some older size 10 carbon iv’s, i hear they run smaller than the 2’s and 3’s, so i think these might be a good option since i’m kind of in between a 9 and a 10.

also looking at some size 9 newer style usd carbon’s, since powerslide got all stupid and have changed their sizing, and supposedly they are slightly bigger than the older size 9’s, but maybe too big?

also maybe the new 5th elements?

and maybe salomons? but it seems like size 8’s would be just a tiny bit too small, and size 9’s probably too big. 

my feet are exactly 267mm long, about 102mm wide. they also have this weird bump towards the back on the outside that sometimes gives me issues depending on the shells.

373,would kindly help find new boot weird wide foot image first comment,rollerblading,"a bit of history. i did a fair amount of aggressive skating from around 1995 to 2001 or so, aged 13-19. i remember salomons being my favorite and most comfortable from back then, i also liked the original 5th elements, but i skated so many kinds i cant even remember them all. was never really that good and ended up just quitting for various reasons. 

i picked it back up very briefly around 2014, age 31, only lasted a year or two. once again, i tried aggressive but im just not very good at it, i did discover how much i love just rolling around and cruising though.

during that time in 2014/2015 i tried a lot of different skates, these were not good fits:
all are US sizing
size 9 usd thrones, waaay too skinny, even bare shells without liners. 
size 9 razors sl’s, width was good on these but they were very bulky and had some extra room lengthwise i didnt like. 
size 9 rb solo’s, cant remember how the length was but too skinny again. 
size 10 usd carbon 2’s, width was good but length was just too long. 
size 9 original run seba cj’s, i remember them being EXTREMELY comfortable, but in an old post on facebook i said i kept stubbing my toes so i guess they were just a tiny bit too small. i remember the width and comfort of these were PERFECT though. 


the only ones i remember fully liking, and not really sure why i sold them, was a pair of size 9 usd carbon 3’s that i peeled some of the skin/liner back from the toes, and cut the carbon out from the toe area with a dremel. 

so here i am again, looking for new boots to cruise around in, maybe some super basic skate park aggressive stuff here and there. i remember really liking the fit of the carbon 3’s that i cut the toes out of. i’ll do it again if i absolutely have to, but it was a huge pain and i would like to just buy something that fits if possible. 

i will mainly be using some k2 r100 frames that i picked up. i prefer flat boots, not the biggest fan of raised heel style boots. 

im looking at some older size 10 carbon iv’s, i hear they run smaller than the 2’s and 3’s, so i think these might be a good option since i’m kind of in between a 9 and a 10.

also looking at some size 9 newer style usd carbon’s, since powerslide got all stupid and have changed their sizing, and supposedly they are slightly bigger than the older size 9’s, but maybe too big?

also maybe the new 5th elements?

and maybe salomons? but it seems like size 8’s would be just a tiny bit too small, and size 9’s probably too big. 

my feet are exactly 267mm long, about 102mm wide. they also have this weird bump towards the back on the outside that sometimes gives me issues depending on the shells. 

so what do you guys think, suggestions, ideas?

387,skate recommendation intermediate urban skater,rollerblading,"Do you guys have any recommendations for a really durable pair of tri-wheel skates?

Please excuse the long post, I just don't know where else to turn for unbiased advice 

**a bit of background:** 

I've been skating a pair of Seba FRX 310s for the past 5 months and I've already managed to crack both boots from regular wear and tear. 

 The FRXs were my first pair of inline skates so I don't really have much of a point of reference with regards to skate preference. That being said, I used to rollerskate so I'd say I'm an intermediate skater. 

In an average skate session, I'll go for 20-30 km, with some pretty high impact jumps (like 2-3 feet off the ground, which in my FRXs, feel like I'm about to crack the skates in half). I'm not particularly heavy (I'm 130 LBS) so I feel like this isn't how my skates should be preforming.

I thought that the FRXs would be able to withstand my jumps and stuff but seeing as I've already cracked them, I am planning on getting another, hopefully more durable, pair of skates.

because the skates broke within the warranty period, SkatePro ([https://www.skatepro.ca/en/d2.htm](https://www.skatepro.ca/en/d2.htm)) has offered me the option of sending another pair of skates of comparable price, as per my choice. I spent $359 (Cad) on the FRXs so I'm hoping to find something within that price range, if possible. 

I also have wide feet, which dissuaded me from getting a pair of RB brand skates (as from my understanding, they're best suited for narrow feet) 

I'm also from Canada, so a lot of the options listed on this reddit page are either:  
A) extremely expensive (for example, Skate Pro has Roller Blade's Twister Edge 110 tri-skate listed for $509.95 CAD) or, B) nearly impossible to find in-stock, or have outrageous shipping prices 

**my current options:**

that being said, I'm trying to find options through [SkatePro.ca](https://SkatePro.ca) so I can use my store credit (though, I am open to other suggestions as I may be able to argue for a full-cash-refund)

On the Skate Pro website ([https://www.skatepro.ca/en/d2.htm](https://www.skatepro.ca/en/d2.htm)), I found:

**Roces EGO 3x110 TIF** ([https://www.skatepro.ca/en/119-38540.htm](https://www.skatepro.ca/en/119-38540.htm)) 

and

**Roces X35 110** ([https://www.skatepro.ca/en/119-29367.htm](https://www.skatepro.ca/en/119-29367.htm))

there are also the Seba/ Fr range of tri-wheel skates, such as the FR1 and FR3, but I'm worried the boot quality would be the same as the FRX. 

they also offer Power Slides, but at my budget, it doesn't look like the quality is much better than my current (broken) pair of FRX 310s-- but please correct me if you guys disagree

Another potential option, though one I'm far less familiar with, would be to buy an aggressive boot and mount it on my existing frames from the FRXs, but I'm not sure if this is even possible. 

the Skate Pro website only has:

**Them 909 Aggressive Inline skate Boot** ([https://www.skatepro.ca/en/64-40211.htm](https://www.skatepro.ca/en/64-40211.htm))

however, I also read posts from users on this page saying that aggressive boots paired with Tri-wheel frames aren't the optimal setup due to lack of ankle support. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/rollerblading/comments/jqauxy/big\_wheel\_setup\_aggressive\_boot\_like\_909\_vs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rollerblading/comments/jqauxy/big_wheel_setup_aggressive_boot_like_909_vs/))

Considering the options that I've seen so far-- from my limited knowledge about inline skates-- the latter option of buying a really durable (potentially aggressive?) boot and mounting it onto my existing tri-wheel frames seems like the best course of action. 

If anyone has any input as to what you guys think I should do/ durable skate recommendations, it would be greatly appreciated and I would be forever indebted to you!

393,advice new wheel v replacing skate entirely,rollerblading,"Hi all,

I am the typical skated a lot as a child, just got back into it recently person. I'm 28.

I recently picked up the  [Powerslide Phuzion Argon Ash 110 Skates](https://rollerwarehouse.com/Powerslide-Phuzion-Argon-Ash-110-Skates.asp) and I'm really enjoying them for riding around.

However, I recently discovered a small skatepark nearby my house and I really like riding around it. However, obviously 110mm wheels don't make great skatepark riding.

I have a really old pair of aggressive skates that from searching the sub people have either never heard of or think are terrible. They are Airwalks, same as the guy's [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rollerblading/comments/c53mq2/newbie_need_help_finding_replacement_parts/).

I took these over to the skatepark and had a lot of fun, so I want to keep doing it. However, my wheels are trash. They barely roll at all, I lose speed going down gentle inclines because of friction in the wheels.

So my question is, should I bother replacing the wheels on my current pair, or should I save up and get new aggressive skates entirely? I haven't skated in nice aggressive skates so I guess I don't really know what I'm missing.

Also, what are people's pad recommendations for skate parks? I'm thinking knee pads are mandatory (and yes I always wear a helmet). Are elbow or wrist pads really helpful for skatepark riding?",hi typical skated lot child got back recently person recently picked powerslide phuzion argon ash skate http rollerwarehouse com powerslide phuzion argon ash skate asp really enjoying riding around however recently discovered small skatepark nearby house really like riding around however obviously mm wheel make great skatepark riding really old pair aggressive skate searching sub people either never heard think terrible airwalks guy post http www reddit com r rollerblading comment c mq newbie need help finding replacement part took skatepark lot fun want keep however wheel trash barely roll lose speed going gentle incline friction wheel question bother replacing wheel current pair save get new aggressive skate entirely skated nice aggressive skate guess really know missing also people pad recommendation skate park thinking knee pad mandatory yes always wear helmet elbow wrist pad really helpful skatepark riding,"['hi', 'typical', 'skated', 'lot', 'child', 'got', 'back', 'recently', 'person', 'recently', 'picked', 'powerslide', 'phuzion', 'argon', 'ash', 'skate', 'http', 'rollerwarehouse', 'com', 'powerslide', 'phuzion', 'argon', 'ash', 'skate', 'asp', 'really', 'enjoying', 'riding', 'around', 'however', 'recently', 'discovered', 'small', 'skatepark', 'nearby', 'house', 'really', 'like', 'riding', 'around', 'however', 'obviously', 'mm', 'wheel', 'make', 'great', 'skatepark', 'riding', 'really', 'old', 'pair', 'aggressive', 'skate', 'searching', 'sub', 'people', 'either', 'never', 'heard', 'think', 'terrible', 'airwalks', 'guy', 'post', 'http', 'www', 'reddit', 'com', 'r', 'rollerblading', 'comment', 'c', 'mq', 'newbie', 'need', 'help', 'finding', 'replacement', 'part', 'took', 'skatepark', 'lot', 'fun', 'want', 'keep', 'however', 'wheel', 'trash', 'barely', 'roll', 'lose', 'speed', 'going', 'gentle', 'incline', 'friction', 'wheel', 'question', 'bother', 'replacing', 'wheel', 'current', 'pair', 'save', 'get', 'new', 'aggressive', 'skate', 'entirely', 'skated', 'nice', 'aggressive', 'skate', 'guess', 'really', 'know', 'missing', 'also', 'people', 'pad', 'recommendation', 'skate', 'park', 'thinking', 'knee', 'pad', 'mandatory', 'yes', 'always', 'wear', 'helmet', 'elbow', 'wrist', 'pad', 'really', 'helpful', 'skatepark', 'riding']",138

Hi,

I'm looking into these new and expensive gaskets which promise performance and comfort but how good are these at keeping that promise?

Can I get an opinion of someone who fell with these on asphalt and can share how that Kevlar is actually holding up in terms of durability and impact absorption?

They say that the Kevlar will be durable and will slide but is that really the reality as these are quite expensive and I wouldn't want to spend all that money to find out that these are useless after few falls.

I'm not very experienced and try and test many new things which naturally result in many falls... is it a good idea to buy these?

Thanks!

409,outside edge glide,rollerblading,"Hi all. 

I'm super frustrated with my outside edge glide. I feel like a lot of my skating skills have really come on line in the last year, but I'm still having terrible maintaining outside edge gliding in an arc without having to eventually cross over with the other foot.  I can sit on the outside edge forever going straight, but if I try to shift my weight to the inside to carve an arc, it always shifts ALL the way over and I end up needing to take the crossover step. 

It's super frustrating since I can do it easily on ice with hockey skates and even on skis with one ski (... I can hold an outside edge carve on one ski for a couple seconds before needing to come back to the inside edge) and my inline skating -- in general -- is way better than my ice skating or skiing. 

My continuous crossovers / continuous cross rolls are pretty solid. And I feel strong on my outside edge as long as I don't try to hold it. 

What are the magic tips?

423,get first skate rb twister edge wd rb macroblade wd universal,rollerblading,"Hello,

I'm deciding between RB Twister Edge &amp; RB Macroblade triskates. The main question is soft/hard boot would suit me better, so maybe some of you could give me an advice on this. 

The thing is that 80% of my skating (at least that I plan) will be fitness/longer distances in parks / bike tracks just to keep myself fit. I do not plan on doing any serious tricks or whatsoever,  just get outside &amp; get some exercise while having fun doing it. Real urban skating (streets, stairs etc) probably will take maximum 20% of my skating time if not less. 

Looking at my activity portrait that I plan on doing it seems that softboot/fitness skate could be a choice for me, but... The thing is that I am a total beginner on inline skates &amp; want to build my skills first.

Is it true that Hardboot skates generally could be more suited for beginners because they provide way more ankle support? Will it be easier to start skating and learn the basics (like T- stop, power stop, skating backwards etc) on hardboot than softshell and soft boots could be too loose/slanty? Also they are probably less durable &amp; maneuverable because of a longer frame which is good for speed but not so good for taking curbs? 

I am confused about what would make a better pair as my first skates -  hardboot or softboot.. Do you guys think the best way to start and build my skills &amp; confidence is to pick hardboot urban skates (Twister Edge) &amp; then sometime in the future get a pair of fitness skates as an additional pair, if I will feel the need for it? 

Is the Macroblade a lot lighter than Twisters? Would it be significantly easier/more comfortable to make 15 miles+  rides on softboot?

So guys what would you get as a first skates - Twister Edge 3WD 110 or Macroblade 110 3WD? Which are more universal? 

Thanks in advance.

But

some things ive noticed:
My lower back hurts so much every time i ride! I cant tell whether it is because i’m using muscles i’m not used to, or whether I’m skating wrong and I’m causing myself problems

445,tight tight shoe,rollerblading,"Hi,

I did just order inline skates size 44 somewhat reluctantly because I remember from my years as a young adult that inline skates are best bought 1 size up, so I would intuitively ordered a 45 (my sneakers are 44). Now the shop had this Mondopoint scale up and I started measuring my food and I ended up with a size &lt; 44 for the shoe, then after some back and forth I ordered the normal-sized shoe.

Fast forward to half an hour ago, I opened my package, stepped in and I am totally unsure about the size. First of all it fits very nicely, except maybe for the big toes that feel a little tight. I don't think I am toughing a seam or the wall though. Now I haven't inline skated for probably 15 years (after excessively as a teenager, tried to order my old Hypno boots but sadly they seem to be discontinued for years now).

Can I expect while skating that the heel traves back and the toe might in turn also be a bit withdrawn?

If there was this skate half-a-size up, I would probably try to order that one, but I fear another size up might be too  large...

So any idea / input?

459,powerslide zoom pro pain hotspot around degree strap,rollerblading,"EDIT: It was the laces. The ones provided were too short, couldn't even make a proper bow, and had them pulled completely tightened. Going to buy longer laces and do the straight lace through the lace holes. 

Hello,

My foot measurements are 27 cm long, and 10 cm wide. According to charts this puts me between a US size 10 and 10.5, and my foot is ranked between narrow and medium. The Powerslide zoom pro is supposed to be one of the wider offerings, but getting pain not just around the 45 degree strap, but along the middle of the foot on both sides, really depending on how I'm skating.

Put about 10 hours of skating into them. Heat molded the myfit liners. Tried taking out insoles to give more room. Just bought a heat gun for heat molding, probably my next step.

\--Has anybody heat-molded to widen the entire middle of the boot, not just like a pressure point? Any tips on this process should I go down this path?--

I'm tempted to try another brand, but this is the second set of skates already, losing $20 on the first, and likely $30 or more selling these. It's just, what if the next boots I find myself in the same boat with fitment issues. I REALLY wish manufactures would at least include a width measurement range in their product specs. It's only fair when many of their customers are buying online, sight unseen. I wish we could get together and petition manufacturers to do this.

\--Anybody have similar sized feet to mine and found a brand that fits like a glove? What size did you get from them?

477,looking advice help,rollerblading,"Hi all,

I am looking for help and advice. I currently have K2 FIT BOA 90's. It was the best a local company had in stock at the time and this was the beginning of the pandemic. They came with 80a stock wheels. I live in Arizona and am using them for outdoor street and sidewalk use for exercise. In conjunction with dieting, the rollerblading has helped me drop 80 lbs. since the pandemic started, so I would like to continue to do this. 

I have a couple different issues.

1) The stock wheels disintegrated pretty quickly. It is very dusty and rocky out here. One actually split in half while I was out for my routine.

2) I replaced them with 82a wheels off amazon and have used them about 8-10 times and now two of the wheels split and I need to replace them.

3) I bought gel pads for my ankles but they do not seem to be helping. My ankles hurt badly on both feet toward the end of my hour routine. Putting a folded sock on top of the gel pad for extra padding seems to help some but they still hurt.

4) The screws for the wheels come undone after a weeks worth of use. I will be blading along and all of a sudden I can tell something is wrong, look down and at least one wheels bearings will have come undone.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a wheel recommended for desert climate or should I just resign myself to the fact I will have to be constantly replacing my wheels? I am not opposed to buy new, better rollerblades if it means I can get prolonged use out of them. If so, any recommendations for my intended use? Any tricks to reduce the pain in my ankles?

507,skate instructor qualified,rollerblading,"Hi everyone,

I started learning with my instructor about 2 weeks ago, I never did any sport so I'm not sure if it's just me.

My instructor didn't wear her rollerblades until the last class, she just made me copy the movements she does with her body. I feel confused and feel like she improvises things and if I can't do something she moves to another thing.

This is what all she made me do so far:

* First class: Stretching my body
* Both second and third class:   
\- Balance with one leg in a half ball for pilates  
\- Skate with just one rollerblade on (trying to make the other leg not touch the ground so fast)  
\- Make a ""fish"" movement like opening and closing my knees skating in a ( ) motion (no idea how it's called)
* Third class:  
\- Skate moving my hips and body to one side and then the other.  
\- In the first one she just said this is powerslide stop and taught me the movement without using rollerblades. In this last one, she made me grab onto a column and do it.

I inquired about exercises to keep practicing alone and she tells me to use one rollerblade and also do some movements without them. I just end up going alone to the park and try to skate but I move very clumsy like a penguin and start skating grabbing onto something for speed.

I got the Rollerblade Macroblade 100 3WD over a year ago and I loved them. For the first 8-9 months they were great, comfortable, and fast. However, since the last month they started hurting my right inner ankle. I thought it was something temporary but it became a recurrent thing. I don't feel pain on my ankle itself, even if I push on it; it's only when I wear the skates. Also, I have the Rollerblade Zetrablade and they don't hurt my ankle AT ALL!

I got ankle booties and I would pad my ankle with double socks, cotton, and all sorts of materials but it still hurts my ankle. It's so weird cuz as I said 2 months ago they were super comfortable. It only happens on my right ankle, the left one is fine.

I can't find any damage on the skates. They seem perfectly fine. Anyone with the same situation?

I basically can't wear the macroblades anymore and I'm thinking of buying the Endurance Elite 100 hoping they don't hurt my ankle.

Any thoughts appreciated!

I try to get into the ole T position they show on youtube but as soon as i do its like the skates just want to fall to the side and I nearly fall over wrecking my ankle. 

Am I best to just get out and get rolling or is there something I can do to get better confidence to stop this happening, or am I doing something stupidly wrong?

Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated.

577,aftermarket liner seba fr eu intuition v v fr something else,rollerblading,"Hey all, I've been skating a SEBA FR1 since last May. My feet are 255mm x 105mm, so I opted for the EU39 boot. The stock liner has fit well and has not packed out so much that the fit has loosened appreciable, despite quite a bit of skating.

While I'm grateful I have a good enough fit as-is, I think I've reached the point where additional support and responsiveness from the liner would be an important component in improving my Wizard skating. Given the strong association between Wizard skating and the Intuition liner, my first thought was to make the switch.

From what I’ve been able to read here, I think these are my options:

* **Intuition V1**, size S (24.5-25.5 mm): given that this was designed with the FR in mind and given that my foot measures at the top end of this liner size, this seems optimal but potentially very hard to find.
* **Intuition V2** S (25.0-26.5 mm) or XS (23.0-24.5 mm): Readily available, but I’m unclear on whether or not either of these liner sizes are a good match for the EU38-39 FR1 shell. I’m also unclear on which of the liners would be right for me given that I’m *not* looking to downsize but I also want a performance fit.
* **THEM Blue/Black Intuition** XS (US 6-7?): I hear that these are considerably thicker, so I suspect they would fit the EU38-39 shell. But would they be as stiff and supportive as the V1/V2 liners?
* **FR Deluxe Intuition** (EU39-40): seems like this would likely be a good option but scarce.

I’m very interested to know what you all think about the various Intuition liners as well as potential alternatives (Roces RL1, Reign V3HT, MyFit Crown).

628,starting heavier side,rollerblading,"Tl;Dr: I’m 5’10, 250 lbs and want to get into skating. I need advice, recommendations, etc, please.

Hi. Quarantine has taken a big toll on my body and I’ve gained a great deal of weight. I’m in the process of dieting and I’m trying to find exercises I enjoy. Rollerblading looks fun, potentially quite practical, and I’ve heard it’s a great exercise. I know it’s something I’ll enjoy as I briefly dabbled in it a while ago but lost interest because I was too young to go to the skatepark whenever I wanted.

My end goal is to be gliding around the skatepark on aggressive inline style blades and have a low-cut, large-wheeled pair for commuting or more casual exercise.

I’m concerned at the moment about my weight and where I’m better off starting. I’m 5’10 and nearly 250 lbs - the only information I could find about upper weight limits suggested 220 lbs for most skates. My theory was that the more stunt-oriented skates would be better for me because they’re designed to withstand the forces of people grinding rails and jumping around on them and seem to provide good ankle support, but most of my early practice will probably be just rolling around my local streets which I’ve heard aggressive inlines aren’t as well suited for. Is my theory here correct and if so, would a sensible idea be for me to compromise and get some aggressive skates and put some bigger, softer wheels on them whilst I build up my confidence and shave off a few pounds?

I've marked on the pictures where the issues are.

Issue 1:

Originally the liner was tight around the toes but this seems to have worn in and been eliminated, however, I am getting quite a lot of friction on the sides of both feet above the arch. I have had this problem since my first session and it starts to get uncomfortable about 30 mins into a session, then I have to pretty much end a session after about an hour as it starts to blister. It is in the exact same spot on both feet so it is obviously an issue I am having with the skate. Any advice on what this could be? Am I not tightening the skates enough?

Issue 2:

How do I fully tighten the top safety buckle? The belt clearly is made to thread through and go inside the boot, but how am I supposed to get it to do this? It isn't on a ratchet so can only be manually pushed through, but stops after only a few nooks.

Issue 3:

Where am I supposed to cut off the tab in front of the tongue of the liner? I've held off on doing this as I didn't want to fuck it up. I know it's specific to the individual, hence multiple tabs, but I'm not sure what that specific is.

The problem was that with my ""baby feet"" (3.5 uk 35.5 eu) the wheels would stick out too much from the front and back. It  made tricks really difficult for me (although I am sure it was possible but it didn't work out for me).

&amp;#x200B;

So with my new setting, I changed for a 219mm frame with the 2 middle wheels in 72mm and the 2 other ones in 68mm. Finally the wheels are \*almost\* completely aligned with the boot !!

&amp;#x200B;

I hope it'll help and feel better, defintly giving it a try soon when the weather is decent tho.

&amp;#x200B;

644,feeling little stuck discouraged,rollerblading,"I'm not usually one to dump my problems to strangers on the internet, but this sub always seems so nice and supportive, so it felt okay to post this. Sorry if it's too long.

Probably sounds like a stupid pity party, but I'm having total beginner skater's block and it's getting me down. I've been skating fitness/recreational style for most of my life and always felt like I was pretty good, so last spring I decided to fulfill a dream of my youth and buy aggressive skates. It took some getting used to, but now I can move around in them (stopping, skating backwards, etc.) about as well as I can in my fitness skates.

Learning tricks has been a struggle. Once I started going to parks, I realized that I didn't have the strength/stamina to jump very high off the ground or pump up and down ramps, so my legs get super tired after less than 30 minutes. I started going to the gym and working on things like squats. Hopefully, that will help eventually, but my progress has been slow. Skating more will help too, of course, but I've run into another more mental issue... 

I didn't realize how lonely it'd be trying to learn on my own! I don't know anyone else who skates aggressive. I'm always the only one at parks. I joined a Facebook group for skaters in my state, but none of them seem to be near me or ever post meet-ups close to me (if they ever post anything at all). I do have a friend who lives about an hour from me who just started quad skating and I've gone to parks with her and her other quad friends a couple of times. It was okay, but they couldn't really give me any pointers and I felt pretty out of place with them. When I see my friend post videos of her amazing progress and thanking her friends for teaching her new tricks, I get real bummed out. 

I can watch YouTube videos and stuff, but I don't feel like I'll really make progress on my own. It'd be nice to have some people, not just to help me learn, but for the supportive community vibes. I do really like skating, I'm just having a hard time with it right now. 

Anyway, I don't know if I'm looking for advice or what, but thanks for reading.",usually one dump problem stranger internet sub always seems nice supportive felt okay post sorry long probably sound like stupid pity party total beginner skater block getting skating fitness recreational style life always felt like pretty good last spring decided fulfill dream youth buy aggressive skate took getting used move around stopping skating backwards etc well fitness skate learning trick struggle started going park realized strength stamen jump high ground pump ramp leg get super tired le minute started going gym working thing like squat hopefully help eventually progress slow skating help course run another mental issue realize lonely trying learn know anyone else skate aggressive always one park joined facebook group skater state none seem near ever post meet ups close ever post anything friend life hour started quad skating gone park quad friend couple time okay really give pointer felt pretty place see friend post video amazing progress thanking friend teaching new trick get real bummed watch youtube video stuff feel like really make progress nice people help learn supportive community vibe really like skating hard time right anyway know looking advice thanks reading,"['usually', 'one', 'dump', 'problem', 'stranger', 'internet', 'sub', 'always', 'seems', 'nice', 'supportive', 'felt', 'okay', 'post', 'sorry', 'long', 'probably', 'sound', 'like', 'stupid', 'pity', 'party', 'total', 'beginner', 'skater', 'block', 'getting', 'skating', 'fitness', 'recreational', 'style', 'life', 'always', 'felt', 'like', 'pretty', 'good', 'last', 'spring', 'decided', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'youth', 'buy', 'aggressive', 'skate', 'took', 'getting', 'used', 'move', 'around', 'stopping', 'skating', 'backwards', 'etc', 'well', 'fitness', 'skate', 'learning', 'trick', 'struggle', 'started', 'going', 'park', 'realized', 'strength', 'stamen', 'jump', 'high', 'ground', 'pump', 'ramp', 'leg', 'get', 'super', 'tired', 'le', 'minute', 'started', 'going', 'gym', 'working', 'thing', 'like', 'squat', 'hopefully', 'help', 'eventually', 'progress', 'slow', 'skating', 'help', 'course', 'run', 'another', 'mental', 'issue', 'realize', 'lonely', 'trying', 'learn', 'know', 'anyone', 'else', 'skate', 'aggressive', 'always', 'one', 'park', 'joined', 'facebook', 'group', 'skater', 'state', 'none', 'seem', 'near', 'ever', 'post', 'meet', 'ups', 'close', 'ever', 'post', 'anything', 'friend', 'life', 'hour', 'started', 'quad', 'skating', 'gone', 'park', 'quad', 'friend', 'couple', 'time', 'okay', 'really', 'give', 'pointer', 'felt', 'pretty', 'place', 'see', 'friend', 'post', 'video', 'amazing', 'progress', 'thanking', 'friend', 'teaching', 'new', 'trick', 'get', 'real', 'bummed', 'watch', 'youtube', 'video', 'stuff', 'feel', 'like', 'really', 'make', 'progress', 'nice', 'people', 'help', 'learn', 'supportive', 'community', 'vibe', 'really', 'like', 'skating', 'hard', 'time', 'right', 'anyway', 'know', 'looking', 'advice', 'thanks', 'reading']",186

I use hard boots(plastic), fairly soft, and well-made liners. My skates are also the right size, and I can confirm, that at least in the foot part, it is tight as it should since my heels keep locked to the base of the skate, and no lifting or wiggling changes that.

I almost never get foot pains, not even when doing some fitness and skating for more than 10 to 15 kilometers.

678,kizer flux custom spacers mm rocker mini review,rollerblading,"Today I had the chance to finally test my Kizer Flux frames with custom 3D printed spacers outside.
I am in no means experienced flow/wizard skater, but this thing definitely felt very similar to my Endless 90. 
For those not familiar with the frame, it is a rare and strange Trinity mount one - plastic 273mm frame, has mini soul plates for basic grinding and stalls, allow dual setup (similar to Endless) 4x90/3x100 and has rockering option. Unfortunately the original rockering is 3mm which is very strange for me.
But here’s the catch. Thanks to ([Justinthursday](https://www.thingiverse.com/Justinthursday) there is 3D custom model for printing of modified spacers with centered axle hole.
And by using the original metal spacers facing up and outside and the custom plastic spacers for the middle wheels, the rocker becomes 1mm.

What are the WIDEST skates in the toe box area? Or, what are the easiest to heat mold in that area? Everything else I can adjust to except for that.

I am trying to stay under $300 and will purchase online in the USA. I will wear with my kiddos while they ride bikes or at the skating rink, and definitely as cardio exercise for myself (my ramp days are over).

Given the pandemic, I can't get to any shops to try anything on, which sucks! But I live near a Decathlon that does click/collect and so would be far easier for returns if sizing is an issue.

My head is full of questions! But, I think mostly:

* Decathlon have an [Oxelo MF500](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/adult-freeride-hardboot-inline-skates-mf500/_/R-p-6097) (their own brand) or some [Powerslide 3x90](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/adult-men-s-3x90mm-powerslide-inline-skates-black-red/_/R-p-X865865) \- any views on either of these? With a hard boot and 4 wheels, I'm guessing the Oxelo will be easier to learn on?
* Should I buy for my shoe size? Or one up, one down?
* Looking at other brands from other threads here, seems like their lower end skates are about £125 - £150 (so double that of the Oxelo) - is that cost difference worth it for a pure beginner?

I imagine skating along paths in parks etc. Not looking at doing any tricks or fancy stuff, if I can stay up and move forwards slowly I will count it as a success!

I have been battling anxiety and depression for several months (I am receiving professional help) and I have been looking for an activity that I can enjoy and that will help distract me from my problems. After seeing many of your videos and posts, I was motivated to give rollerblading a go and I think I found such activity. I put some music on my cell phone, I slide, feel the wind against me, and I feel free and very happy, something that has been difficult for me to feel for a long time.

I'm looking into purchasing a pair of Fr1 80's. I've played hockey my whole life and like a tight skate. I've measured my foot from heel to toe and both of my feet are 260mm in length.

I was going to go for a 43EU/US size 10  since I usually wear a size 9 or 9.5 but now that I actually measured my foot it the sizing guide says I should go for a size  40 EU/7.5 US.

742,intuition liner shell might little big bad idea,rollerblading,"I recently got a pair of the 3W Twister Edge skates, love them/think they are super sexy, BUT after skating in them for 6+ hours, I realized they were the wrong size.   
Im a 10.5 (44 EU) shoe, 26.8 Mondo.   
After having a hard time getting the 10.5s (44EU)  on, I went with the 11s (44.5 EU)  
Conflicting size suggestions/peoples anecdotal experiences with fit kinda bamboozled me...  
Now that ive skated them a decent amount, I can feel that my feet do not have a lot of control as the liners have broken in and there's space above the front of my foot.  
Extra socks help but it still feels less responsive than it should be.

I wanted to get some intuition liners for them, but worry it'll actually make the problem even worse, since they are typically used for downsizing skates...   
With my foot in the shell without the liner, I have about a fingers width on the side of my foot, and about two fingers behind my heel. 

My 26.8cm feet also put me directly between a S and M Intuition liner, but those liners are advertised as being for shells that are 7-9 (40-42 EU) ! Seems dramatically far off from my 11 (44.5 EU) skates...

If I get a M Intuition liner, will it be way too small for my shell?

I got some insoles and thought I could experiment with adding some material in the shell to help it fit the liner more snuggly, but at what point should I just cut my losses and get a new pair of skates that are the right size?

Im not a professional by any means, but still want to prioritize control/response, with a still comfortable fit. Im going to be doing more than just casual skating.

763,review powerslide next v rollerblade twister edge trying maxxum edge anyone researching,rollerblading,"Powerslide NEXT 125 - these scared me at first because they felt slightly large when I ordered them in my normal size. Make sure you read the info on the slides because in order for them to feel snug, you have to make modifications. Don’t worry though because the modifications are built into the skate. This includes guidelines for cutting the wings on the top cuff for better support. The next are a good-for-cruising, all day skate. Unfortunately, if you have a skinny foot, you may want to order a fatboy liner at an additional cost. 

Pros = tremendous comfort, especially for wider feet. Easy break-in, excellent speed retention, high quality waxed laces. Trinity mounting system is pure gold! 110 conversion would be super easy. Wicked bearings are serviceable. 

Cons = flimsy top cuff strap. Weak 45 degree latch. The latch can easily bend/break. Possibility of an additional cost if another liner is needed. Powerslide Imperial is better for a thinner foot

Rollerblade Twister Edge 110 - order these one size up if you have wider feet and order them true to size if your feet are narrow. They scared me at first due to the snug fit. However, you have to earn it to learn it with these skates. By that I mean you have to go through a few uncomfortable skate sessions before they eventually become outstanding in fit and feel. They’re more maneuverable than the 125mm wheels and also, in my opinion/theory, more maneuverable because they hold the foot better than the next boot (even if it were the next 110). Keep in mind that could change with the addition of the fatboy liner. Also keep in mind the new fatboy liner = $100. As of right now, my favorite daily skate is the twister. 

Pros = They’re extremely well built and incredibly durable. Tremendous foot support with no slip. Insane maneuverability. Incredible skate once broken in. Color kits are still available. 

Cons = The break-in period can be grueling for the first few sessions. Availability is low in larger sizes (not necessarily rollerblade’s fault. 

TAKEAWAY = If I could only choose one, it would be the edge. That said, it’s a decision that could change depending on the skating I do. Longer distances, the NEXT is a luxury car cruiser that I’ll pick every time. You can tell both companies really care about what they’re putting on the market. Both seem to want to accommodate their customers with options. As a result of skating in both, I have actually ordered the maxxum edge 125. This is because of what I’m wanting personally from the skate via research and time in the boots. I want the 125mm speed of the next  with twister edge levels of durability and support. Whichever you choose, you can’t go wrong. If you’re still on the fence after reading this, buy the skate based on your taste in looks.

It is super wet now. It is forecast to be dry all day... The rain for an hour at 18:00!!! Which will wipe out most of tomorrow too, at least.

Arrrggghhhh!!!

I used to be an ice hockey skater (not player lol) so the entire process was exactly the same for me: except the break. In ice hockey skating, I would put all my weight on my heels. Now when I do this while skating, it rubs the break and causes a bumpy ride. 
This might be a stupid question, but how do I prevent this? Where do I put my center? Would it be a poor decision to remove the break completely? 
I would just like some insight on how to change my technique coming from an ice hockey perspective.",hi today got impala inline skate decided make cute first issue using back break used ice hockey skater player lol entire process exactly except break ice hockey skating would put weight heel skating rub break cause bumpy ride might stupid question prevent put center would poor decision remove break completely would like insight change technique coming ice hockey perspective,"['hi', 'today', 'got', 'impala', 'inline', 'skate', 'decided', 'make', 'cute', 'first', 'issue', 'using', 'back', 'break', 'used', 'ice', 'hockey', 'skater', 'player', 'lol', 'entire', 'process', 'exactly', 'except', 'break', 'ice', 'hockey', 'skating', 'would', 'put', 'weight', 'heel', 'skating', 'rub', 'break', 'cause', 'bumpy', 'ride', 'might', 'stupid', 'question', 'prevent', 'put', 'center', 'would', 'poor', 'decision', 'remove', 'break', 'completely', 'would', 'like', 'insight', 'change', 'technique', 'coming', 'ice', 'hockey', 'perspective']",59
779,powerslide phuzion x noobie question,rollerblading,"Hey folks,


I've just gotten into skating. About 15 years ago I can remember goign to the occasionaly Birthday Party at the Skating Rink around my old home-town but, it's been a LONG time haha. So I picked up the best comprimise I could find; I wanted something I could skate imperfect sidewalks, concrete, and occasionally take to the skate park just for fun.


Well I settled on the Phuzion Krypton Grey 100's, it's got 3 massive wheels and I figured I'd pick skating back up in a couple hours... boy was I wrong. 

First off I feel like I""m constantly about to bust ass; I can't seem to push NEARLY as well with my left foot as I can with my right. I'm just in that akward brand new phase that I hate so much; I was cussing myself out with words that would turn a Nun gay. It was maddening.


What I'm curious about bois and gurls; does anyone have the Power Phuzions? It seems online that folks sell different frames all over the place; whatever suits your needs right? Well I'm curious if I can buy ANY  frame and put it on my Phuzions? How do I determine what frame's WILL fit? I'm so sorry it's such a noob asd question; but I promise give 30 days and I'll be MUCH more up to speed.


I""m practicing an hour or two a day; starting, stopping, turning. So far stopping is the hardest part for sure; turning is a close second, and starting is rough too.

792,fit issue bladies,rollerblading,"I bought Bladies and have been having an awful time getting them to fit. Here are my issues so far:

&amp;#x200B;

1. At first, I felt like the top of my foot just behind my toes was being crushed. I thought maybe I could just break them in, so I tolerated it for awhile. It never improved to the level of being able to wear them comfortably for more than \~30 minutes. I saw someone remove a piece of boot plastic right past the bottom eyelets to fix a similar issue, so I did the same and I think it worked. I've literally never had this issue so I think this is more of a design flaw than a problem of me having a high volume foot in this area.
2. I think the liner is slightly too small. I'm a size 38 EU and bought the 36-38 EU so this isn't a huge shock. The length seems fine but the toebox area is SO narrow. I do have a wide toebox, but it seems much narrower than even a typical woman's foot. I am currently trying to stretch it out with balled up socks shoved in. It doesn't look like it's heat moldable, so no go on that. The issue with this too is if I get a bigger liner, I worry it'll be too big for the skate itself since I'm on the upper end of the sizing and my toes do touch the end right now. The Myfit is already a pretty slim liner, so I don't think I could go with something with less padding either. Any advice appreciated.
3. I'm having pain just below and in front of my ankle bone. I tried to google some keywords related to this and it seems common in hockey skates? Lots of suggestions to ""punch out"" that area, but not sure the best way to try to do it on aggressive inlines in a plastic boot. I currently have an object shoved in the boot in that area to encourage it to expand a bit. Anything else that might help?

I jumped into inlines because I realized I was doing a lot of trail skating on my quads, and would like to do some street skating as well. I ended up getting the K2 Alexis 84s and realized I am really not used to so much wheel jutting out in front so I'm looking into rockering. (Or, alternatively, I've only worn them indoors so I can return them and get a shorter wheelbase - any opinions appreciated!) If I go the rockering route, is an appropriate size -4mm from the larger wheels, or should I go even smaller?

Im waiting on the small to arrive but now im worried about if when these new v2 liners come will my boot be too big for the liner? Should i downsize the boot to a 40 since thats when the shell actually changes size? Or will the 42 boot be okay with a size small intuition liner? Thank you!

after skating for nearly 1 year I finally decided to live my dream of aggressive skating.

After reading some post here I got scared that I actually took the wrong size since I saw some users recommending others to take the closer size to your feet for a better performance, that would put me on the EU39 aka 24 cm.

Considering that I usually wear thick socks while skating and that my right feet has a little lower arch ( so I have to tighten it more than the left one on my Twister Edge  ) should I change my order ?

858,newbie skater trouble bearing friction,rollerblading,"About two months ago I bought my first pair of rollerblades and have been absolutely loving it. After a while, I noticed my wheels were wearing down significantly and in an uneven manner. I decided to get some new wheels and upgrade the bearings while I was at it, as the default bearings were pressed metal and weren't serviceable. 

Installation was simple but now I'm having a big issue with friction. The wheels simply won't free spin for more than a few seconds, and when I skate on them they noticeably slow me down and bring me to a halt without active effort. I didn't see a rule on links, and I'm not trying to sell stuff, so here are the skates I have, and the parts I bought:

[Skates](https://www.rollerblade.com/usa/products/advantage-pro-xt-w-2)

[Wheels](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KHRGBCP)

[Bearings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077F62YP7)

[Spacers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08C78Q3KG)

I tried the spacers that were in the old wheels, in and the ones linked above to no avail. It's not the bearings themselves, because when I hold the wheel between my fingers and spin it, it free spins for quite a while.

One of my theories is that the frame that the wheel sit in is pressing up against the wheel/bearing when tightened and is causing friction, but there are no visible signs of that.

I got a pair of Roce m12 aggressive skates as I thought it would be fun to start learning a few tricks. Problem is that there is only 2 wheels, 2 grind wheels and they seem super slow and hard as hell.

Let's go a bit further... Same thing with 4x100 setup. There is K2 R100 frame for under 100USD. With 11mm thick plastic block they become 165mm Mount Rockerable frame. Rockerable.

If possible I'd rather not have to buy 2 completely different sets of skates for urban street skating and hitting the bowl at the park.

The size 7 seemed painfully small but I only wore them around my apartment. The 7.5 seemed to fit much better so I returned the 7. Now that I've been out on the streets with 7.5, my foot feels like its moving around a little in them and it doesn't feel like i have the right fit for optimum performance. I put some insoles in and it seemed to work although it almost felt too tight. My question is - should i give the size 7 another shot and try and break them in even though they felt painfully small?  or play around with using insoles in the 7.5 - i just thought maybe it was wiser to not use insoles at all and find the perfect fit but it's possible there is no perfect fit for me and better to go a little larger and use insoles. I could also wear thicker sock but then in the summer my feet might feel uncomfortably warm.

930,head hurt trying find right size new skate seba high light size,rollerblading,"TLDR: do SEBA High Lights become noticably bigger (0.5-1 size) after breaking in and I should go a size down? Or not?

So Im looking at the SEBA High LIGHTS (not the Seba Highs, Id prefer the integrated liners) for slalom skating, never really had proper skates before and since I can only find them in online shops I have no way to try them on.

Im size ~38.5 EU / ~5.5 UK, as for mondopoint, I tried measuring multiple times but I always kinda get different results between 240-250mm, probably closer to 240. According to the SEBA size chart this fits right between size 38 and 39.

So slalom skates should fit tightly, even too tightly at first, and after breaking in theyre like 0.5 size bigger? But I also read that with SEBA I should go one size up. Also width is a factor too and since Im a woman these skates might be too big in the toe box area and such.

Im giving a thought to SEBA Trix Women too which come in size 38.5 and probably have a better width, but theres no way Ill use those Y cuffs, then again those can be changed afaik. (also fuck that dumb pink color, just why..)

I didn’t respond to all the comments but I read and appreciated them all.

Today I went to a big park near me with my new rollerblades and gear. My boyfriend came with me and cycled along side me for the first half hour because he could tell I was nervous and I was SURE I would lose balance and fall. I didn’t at all!  At first I was a little shaky but muscle memory kicked in and I remembered how to balance my weight. After 40 minutes or so I felt really confident and was able to pick up some speed. I still need to practice slowing down and braking but it was honestly the best day of 2021 so far for me. 

My favourite moment was when two little girls on rollerblades (maybe 6 or 7 y/o) came up to me and told me my rollerblades were “cool”. It really warmed my heart ❤️

I’m looking to make my first purchase and I don’t mind spending some decent money on something that’s gonna get me moving and I love to nerd out about everything I get into. 

I live in jersey in the Philly suburbs with some paved trails and general sidewalks and stuff near me but I also live right next to the train station so either way it’s gonna be a lot of street and concrete. 

My dilemma is the choice between a more “casual” skate with bigger wheels for smoother ride because I’m mostly interested in getting active and combining the hobby with my videography work...or with a more aggressive(?) style skate that I can grind with because I like the idea of getting to that level and I like the look of those skates.

How big of a difference would I notice in the smoothness of the ride between wheel size/style/etc?

I realize I’m asking a kind of broad questions but if anyone can help me shed a little light and/or throw some suggestions at me, I’d really appreciate it because I’m having trouble finding some answers. 

For reference I loved the look of the Rollerblade Twister Edge/110 or on the other side I see stuff like the USD Aeon 60 or Seba stuff mentioned a lot. Like i mentioned I don’t mind spending the money if it’s gonna accomplish something.

986,fr stock liner still little tight break upgrade intuition liner teeny bit space worth,rollerblading,"Hello!

As the title suggests, overall i am mighty happy with my EU size 46 FR-1 however even after break in period, they still feel uncomfortably tight at some spots (specially around lateral arch region). I have already upgraded the soles to Superfeet Carbon Pro, which increased comfort already a significant bit, I have already tried to heat-form the Shell itself a teenyweeny bit around the lateral arch, which also made some difference however it still could be a bit less tight around the arch and the toes to make me 100% satisfied.

Now if i have understood things properly, the Intuition liners are supposedly a fair bit thinner walled than the FR-1 stock liners, so did i get that right that they increase foot space when i upgrade to them?

I know they are not cheap but if the result is me using the skates even more often, its money well spent in my opinion.

Anyone upgraded from Stock Liners to Intuitions and can share some experience/wisdom with me?

Thanks in advance!

I bought Rollerblade Twister Edge 110 3WD skates in size 9 a year ago, and have skated in them quite a bit. The problem is, they hurt the inward curves of my feet after I get a lot of blood pumping to my feet. They hurt so bad that I need to take a break or the pain is quite extreme. 

Can anyone point me in the right direction? I have heard that K2 skates are good for average feet, but the wheels might be a little too far apart for my likening.

The reason I say I need tri-skates is out of an unfortunate necessity, due to the rough asphalt roads that surround my house. The Twister Edge skates fixed this issue well enough. However, I would *strongly prefer* the skates to be as agile as possible. (I've had to learn powerstops in these 110 wheels and I'm making serious progress :)

1071,another skate recommendaiton post,rollerblading,"Hey!

Another one of these. Sorry. Basically I've been skating for a few months now and feel pretty comfortable with the fundamentals on some [80mm wheels](https://www.inlineskates.com/5th-Element-ST-80-Urban-Inline-Skates/383168P,default,pd.html). However, when skating around Austin the thing that bugs me the most are rough roads, where I find myself constantly just wishing for smoother surfaces. As a result, I'm kinda leaning towards a triskate 110 ride. 

The main annoyances I have for my interest are really scuffed/cracked roads, [this beautiful but brick](https://capitalplanning.utexas.edu/sites/cpc.utexas.edu/files/styles/lightbox_full/public/speedway-1.jpg?itok=Vyvm1Hi4) road on my university, and [this lovely incline](https://i.imgur.com/xP62RuG.png) going from campus to my gf's apartment. My current scuffed rollerblades aren't very good at going up hills, so I imagine even though I'm making the jump from 80s to 110s going up hills (hopefully) wouldn't be much worse

My current skates are pretty cheap so I'm willing to shell out some more cash (like in the 200/300s) for a nice pair. However, I don't think I'll do anything past the basics (I don't see myself doing jumps, slalom, etc.) with riding and simple tricks. So overall, I think my best interest here are some 110mm triskates that are fairly nice (200-350 range), but I don't really care for any bells and whistles that the super nice skates may offer if it means I can save a few dollars if that makes sense. The reason I make this distinction is it seems like FR1s and better than FRXs, but perhaps in my case there's no real value I'd personally get out of the higher tier stuff. 

I've also seen people take into consideration feet size. My feet are 10 inches long and 4 inches wide (though I typically wear size 11 shoes o_o). I think that's relevant based on the what I've read.

1077,new wheel v new skate noob,rollerblading,"Hi all, hope this is an appropriate question in here.  


I have just recently started learning to rollerblade (bit late at 29 but whatever) and bought some second hand agressive Reaction(?) skates with eaten up wheels for £30 - didn't want to splash out on a new hobby before I know I will stick with it.  


So now that I got more comfortable, I would like to get an upgrade. The choice, from what I understand, is either get new wheels and bearings, ot get new skates. I have found a pair of lovely urban skates I'd like (Twister Edge X, and yes, I went by the looks pretty much), but they are a bit pricey.

A lot people have minor sizing issues (small hot spots, slight heel lift etc) which can lead to poor experiences with their skates. A lot of advice I read on here is to instantly downsize like its a silver bullet. Many people (like myself) cannot downsize do to the shapes or size of their feet of the shell/liner sizing of the skate they have. In many cases there is also significant expense involved when trying to downsize, whether it is shipping to return the skates or having to fork out to buy a whole new pair.    

The video's are not mine and are from a snowboarder but they work just as well for inline skates. Before downsizing try some of these. They can save you a whole lot of time and money and fix minor fit issues. I personally have used the ankle wrap technique on my Remz.

First of all the only women's skates that exist are rec skates and the only thing that makes them targeted towards women is that theyre a pretty color.

There's no regard for the different shape of women's feet compared to men's feet, other than them being available in a different size range (so men who want pretty skates cant have them).

Then there's impala's inlines which only upside is that theyre pretty but theyre shit skates. Furthermore Impala is racist towards its POC influencers.

Hardboot skates usually start at a size 38 which is too large for a lot of women who want more than a rec skate. Only choice is to get kiddo skates which might have a too low weight rating and thus are unsafe to use. 

Rollerblade has a Twister edge model for women. Youd think that this skate takes into account the differnces between men's and women's feet as it's bloody expensive. Nope it's just another pretty pink skate. 
To top it off, note that there's multiple ""special"" Twister edge models. Like there's the normal one, the 3wd, the x, and the one for women. Because it's already special enough that it's for women. No woman would want a 3wd or anything.

1130,specific city recreational skating buying question chronic pain disability consideration,rollerblading,"So a hot minute ago I was diagnosed with a couple chronic conditions that basically culminate in chronic pain and being easily tuckered out

I'm dying to get back into skating, as I haven't really had the chance since I was a teen, but back then it was a case of I got these skates for Christmas and I just roll around 

I'm not suuuper familiar with terms yet so please be gentle with specific lingo in the replies, but I'm wondering if people would have ideas that fit my specific requirements

1) COMFORT - hard boot is a given for support, but padding and boots for wide feet are real important to me to ease recovery time after skating (so I can still walk around the house lol)

2) EASE - now when I say ease, I'm talking ease in getting to a faster speed

This specific requirement is what I've been umming about for a bit. Smaller wheels are obviously ideal, like 80mm? being the standard, but I was wondering if getting bigger wheels would mean I don't have to push as hard to get to the same speed. I'm not looking to get into aggressive skating or anything, but I think I'd prefer a wheel that lets me get to the same speed with less push, if that makes sense, and having to learn to manage staying at a sensible speed, than a skate that requires more push power.

Poorly explained, but basically I'm looking to need less physical effort to match a normal skater's speed as I'm physically less able, and I'm wondering if this is in the wheels

3) DURABILITY - UK pavements are shit, cracks and stuff everywhere, local councils don't give af about fixing shit up - would this just mean hard boot and hard wheels for stability and wear respectively? I haven't been able to figure out what the rollerblade equivalent of suspension is, so insight would be amazing!!

If you got this far, thank you for taking the time to (hopefully) help out! I've been (literally) dreaming about slapping on some skates again so I'm hoping I can find a good setup that lets me perform normally without fucking myself up too much!!

1134,question returning hockey skate,rollerblading,"Howdy y'all!

I'm new to this subreddit and I've got a few questions

A little over a year ago, I bought some brand new Bauer Vapor XR 300 skates, within about 4 skate sessions I bent the chassis on the right skate of the XR 300s. About a year ago I only weighed 210-215 and gained weight due to the pandemic and being out of work lol. Before the XR300s I had a pair of Bauer Vapor RX 15's which lasted me YEARS, before they were stolen, I think I got it for Christmas back in 2013 or 2014. 

\*Important to the context of these following questions\*

*I'm currently 23 years old, 6'0"" weigh around 240 lbs.* 

  
I know for the most part you get what you pay for with hockey skates so I'd say my budget is around $200-$500 dollars. I'm looking to reinvest into some skates and start shedding the pounds. I'm also playing hockey quite casually, mostly for weight loss, off ice practice, and casual play with a few close buddies. I'm a novice when it comes to shopping for new hockey blades. I can't really tell what's a durable skate that will stay strong on me. I have no idea what to look for.....

So I come to you asking the following:

1. Is the new(ish) Bauer Vapor X2.7s worth investing? I don't want to abandon hope on Bauer skates just because the XR 300s bent on me.
2. Is something like the CCM Tacks more durable for it's price? Not opposed to learning straight but will take me time to get used to.
3. Should I spend the extra cash and get the Marsblade O1s? I'm interested in picking up beer league ice hockey with a few of my buddies after the virus, would totally love to try Marsblades if recommended.

Thank you all for your feedback I really appreciate it, hope everyone is staying safe in these trying times! :)",howdy new subreddit got question little year ago bought brand new bauer vapor xr skate within skate session bent chassis right skate xr year ago weighed gained weight due pandemic work lol xr pair bauer vapor rx lasted year stolen think got christmas back important context following question currently year old weigh around lb know part get pay hockey skate say budget around dollar looking reinvest skate start shedding pound also playing hockey quite casually mostly weight loss ice practice casual play close buddy novice come shopping new hockey blade really tell durable skate stay strong idea look come asking following new ish bauer vapor x worth investing want abandon hope bauer skate xr bent something like ccm tack durable price opposed learning straight take time get used spend extra cash get marsblade interested picking beer league ice hockey buddy virus would totally love try marsblades recommended thank feedback really appreciate hope everyone staying safe trying time,"['howdy', 'new', 'subreddit', 'got', 'question', 'little', 'year', 'ago', 'bought', 'brand', 'new', 'bauer', 'vapor', 'xr', 'skate', 'within', 'skate', 'session', 'bent', 'chassis', 'right', 'skate', 'xr', 'year', 'ago', 'weighed', 'gained', 'weight', 'due', 'pandemic', 'work', 'lol', 'xr', 'pair', 'bauer', 'vapor', 'rx', 'lasted', 'year', 'stolen', 'think', 'got', 'christmas', 'back', 'important', 'context', 'following', 'question', 'currently', 'year', 'old', 'weigh', 'around', 'lb', 'know', 'part', 'get', 'pay', 'hockey', 'skate', 'say', 'budget', 'around', 'dollar', 'looking', 'reinvest', 'skate', 'start', 'shedding', 'pound', 'also', 'playing', 'hockey', 'quite', 'casually', 'mostly', 'weight', 'loss', 'ice', 'practice', 'casual', 'play', 'close', 'buddy', 'novice', 'come', 'shopping', 'new', 'hockey', 'blade', 'really', 'tell', 'durable', 'skate', 'stay', 'strong', 'idea', 'look', 'come', 'asking', 'following', 'new', 'ish', 'bauer', 'vapor', 'x', 'worth', 'investing', 'want', 'abandon', 'hope', 'bauer', 'skate', 'xr', 'bent', 'something', 'like', 'ccm', 'tack', 'durable', 'price', 'opposed', 'learning', 'straight', 'take', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'spend', 'extra', 'cash', 'get', 'marsblade', 'interested', 'picking', 'beer', 'league', 'ice', 'hockey', 'buddy', 'virus', 'would', 'totally', 'love', 'try', 'marsblades', 'recommended', 'thank', 'feedback', 'really', 'appreciate', 'hope', 'everyone', 'staying', 'safe', 'trying', 'time']",157

I use them mostly for mobility and I love them. I find them super comfortable and I can skate long distances on them without a problem. Recently the wheels became completely unusable and I was debating whether to buy new wheels or outright buy new skates, but I had a few questions, since I've never used any other skates.

1) My skates are hard-boot. I fear soft-boots will be uncomfortable because of the lack of support. Has anyone experienced this? Was this a problem?

2) I fear that if I just buy new 76mm wheels (the max allowed by my frame) they won't last as long as maybe 100mm wheels (since there's less material overall). Is this a valid concern?

1159,psa beginner,rollerblading,"There is a reason that recreational and other lower-tier skates have a heel brake and mid- to upper-tier skates have no brake at all. The heel brake is largely intended for casual skaters who have little interest in improving their skills. Nothing wrong with it, it’s just meant for people who only need a very basic skillset and not much more. If you are in this category, the brake is a good option for you. 
If, in the other hand, you are reading this subreddit, chances are you are more than a casual skater who wants to be a better skater, whether you’ve been skating for 30 days or 30 years. That’s me and most people here. If you are, then that heel brake is not your friend. It is a psychological crutch... beginners often ask ‘how can you stop without a brake?’ This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the kinematics (properties of motion) of inline skating. The heel brake was never designed to be a full brake to begin with. It was intended to slow the skater in order to make more advanced stopping techniques more accessible from speed. If you want to see kinematics in an easily understandable form, watch these odd, but intriguing, Wizard skaters (I’m not making fun, Wizards, it’s just new to me and I’m currently trying to learn this style). They have mastered the ‘feel’ of the skate, its contact with the ground, and the forces that dictate their motion. Most don’t memorize the foot placement necessary to perform their little swirly doos and flopsy flips, but instead they are going with the flow of the forces transmitted between foot and ground, making usually very small, quick positional adjustments in order to maintain a smooth flow. If their wheels could draw on the ground, you’d see lots of curved, but connected lines that have a traceable flow to them. That’s because they aren’t muscling the skates into doing what they want, but are instead adapting their bodies to the forces of motion. 
All of this to say that when considering the added 3 to 4 inches of aft frame length a heel brake provides, and the adjustments one must consciously make to avoid allowing it to get in the way and cause a wipe out, and considering the considerable lack of true stopping power when compared to more “proper” stopping techniques, the heel brake quickly loses its appeal to the skater who intends to advance. Becoming accustomed to the feel of skating motion, which means learning to trust your equipment, is a superior means, in my opinion, of advancing as a skater. 
Heel brakes interfere with crossovers, for example. The more sharply you need to turn, the more severe your x over angle, i.e., the closer your crossing skate needs to be to the grounded shin. If you catch that brake on your cuff or shell top, chances are you’re gonna eat asphalt. 
Heel brakes also can’t stop you effectively in an emergency. If you go to cross a street and a car suddenly shows up, you don’t want to slow to a gentle stop. You want to stop. Now. The drag brake (T brake) is not much better than a heel brake, but it does improve stopping distance as you can put more rubber to pavement and you can control the pressure much more effectively than by raising your toe to heel brake. But more importantly, drag braking will begin to teach you the kinematics of skating. You’ll feel the dragged skate trying to roll out and make you do a split (because wheels don’t want to slide, they want to roll). It will force you to acclimate yourself to being off balance and make corrections before you bail, because drag braking does tend to challenge your balance at first. 
It also opens the door to more effective techniques like power slides and slalom stops. If you want to avoid that car or wall or kid or BMXer, you’ll need these in your arsenal eventually. 

So, please lose the brake while you’re new. Unlearning bad muscle memory is a tricky thing to do. 

If you made it this far, thanks for hearing me out. Good luck.

Till this very day the ""Fruitboot"" smear still sticks across skateparks and resentment while lessened (Thanks to a mutual hatred of Scooters), has still passed down somewhat between Boarders and Bladers.

Also while I love Aggressive Inline, even I will admit that Skateboarding just generally looks more impressive and visceral at the skatepark, to the average person, the most basic kick flip off a box looks far more impressive than some of the most technical grinds and high level aggressive skating and sadly this seems to be the case whenever I show awesome Aggressive videos like the old X-Games vids of Yasutoko's or the Vine St or even Braille Aggressive videos. 

Though here's the thing, when I show people videos of Bladers blasting through streets at top speed, speeding and drifting around the corners of the mazelike of alleys in a European city or even the relaxing flow videos just showing off the city and urban environment they're in, everyone thinks ""This stuff is great"" and it is great the same reason watching Parkour is great or playing [Mirrors Edge](https://youtu.be/2N1TJP1cxmo?t=23) is great. There is just something inherently satisfying about watching people go through an Urban Environment at speed finding the best and interesting lines to maintain speed and that is something Rollerblading is extremely fantastic at If someone merges Rollerblading with Parkour jesus that would be a monster to watch. This is also something, Skateboarding really can't do as well, bombing hills sure, longboarding yeah okay, but it doesn't compare to the weaving in and out and versatility you see in an urban flow/freeskating video.

Another thing as well I've noticed, FISE, by merging what seems to be Freeskating with Aggressive seems to be far more interesting to watch than classic Aggressive Inline. It looks to be an Aggressive inline that focuses more on maintaining flows and speed to pull off high power Vert style tricks off boxes and such and that shit is cool.

If Skating does make a comeback and I think we've all started to see an uptake in recent years, it's going to be because of the uptake of Free/flow skating thanks to influencers and youtbers and probably not Aggressive I suspect.

Do you agree? I just don't think Skateboarding industry would have come after blading so hard if Blading wasn't seen as ""copying them"" and encroaching on their turf.",much inline skating bad reputation legitimately come poking already established skateboarding industry bear retaliate extremely homophobic effective smear campaign skater till day fruitboot smear still stick across skateparks resentment lessened thanks mutual hatred scooter still passed somewhat boarder bladers also love aggressive inline even admit skateboarding generally look impressive visceral skatepark average person basic kick flip box look far impressive technical grind high level aggressive skating sadly seems case whenever show awesome aggressive video like old x game vids yasutoko vine st even braille aggressive video though thing show people video bladers blasting street top speed speeding drifting around corner mazelike alley european city even relaxing flow video showing city urban environment everyone think stuff great great reason watching parkour great playing mirror edge http youtu n tjp cxmo great something inherently satisfying watching people go urban environment speed finding best interesting line maintain speed something rollerblading extremely fantastic someone merges rollerblading parkour jesus would monster watch also something skateboarding really well bombing hill sure longboarding yeah okay compare weaving versatility see urban flow freeskating video another thing well noticed fise merging seems freeskating aggressive seems far interesting watch classic aggressive inline look aggressive inline focus maintaining flow speed pull high power vert style trick box shit cool skating make comeback think started see uptake recent year going uptake free flow skating thanks influencers youtbers probably aggressive suspect agree think skateboarding industry would come blading hard blading seen copying encroaching turf,"['much', 'inline', 'skating', 'bad', 'reputation', 'legitimately', 'come', 'poking', 'already', 'established', 'skateboarding', 'industry', 'bear', 'retaliate', 'extremely', 'homophobic', 'effective', 'smear', 'campaign', 'skater', 'till', 'day', 'fruitboot', 'smear', 'still', 'stick', 'across', 'skateparks', 'resentment', 'lessened', 'thanks', 'mutual', 'hatred', 'scooter', 'still', 'passed', 'somewhat', 'boarder', 'bladers', 'also', 'love', 'aggressive', 'inline', 'even', 'admit', 'skateboarding', 'generally', 'look', 'impressive', 'visceral', 'skatepark', 'average', 'person', 'basic', 'kick', 'flip', 'box', 'look', 'far', 'impressive', 'technical', 'grind', 'high', 'level', 'aggressive', 'skating', 'sadly', 'seems', 'case', 'whenever', 'show', 'awesome', 'aggressive', 'video', 'like', 'old', 'x', 'game', 'vids', 'yasutoko', 'vine', 'st', 'even', 'braille', 'aggressive', 'video', 'though', 'thing', 'show', 'people', 'video', 'bladers', 'blasting', 'street', 'top', 'speed', 'speeding', 'drifting', 'around', 'corner', 'mazelike', 'alley', 'european', 'city', 'even', 'relaxing', 'flow', 'video', 'showing', 'city', 'urban', 'environment', 'everyone', 'think', 'stuff', 'great', 'great', 'reason', 'watching', 'parkour', 'great', 'playing', 'mirror', 'edge', 'http', 'youtu', 'n', 'tjp', 'cxmo', 'great', 'something', 'inherently', 'satisfying', 'watching', 'people', 'go', 'urban', 'environment', 'speed', 'finding', 'best', 'interesting', 'line', 'maintain', 'speed', 'something', 'rollerblading', 'extremely', 'fantastic', 'someone', 'merges', 'rollerblading', 'parkour', 'jesus', 'would', 'monster', 'watch', 'also', 'something', 'skateboarding', 'really', 'well', 'bombing', 'hill', 'sure', 'longboarding', 'yeah', 'okay', 'compare', 'weaving', 'versatility', 'see', 'urban', 'flow', 'freeskating', 'video', 'another', 'thing', 'well', 'noticed', 'fise', 'merging', 'seems', 'freeskating', 'aggressive', 'seems', 'far', 'interesting', 'watch', 'classic', 'aggressive', 'inline', 'look', 'aggressive', 'inline', 'focus', 'maintaining', 'flow', 'speed', 'pull', 'high', 'power', 'vert', 'style', 'trick', 'box', 'shit', 'cool', 'skating', 'make', 'comeback', 'think', 'started', 'see', 'uptake', 'recent', 'year', 'going', 'uptake', 'free', 'flow', 'skating', 'thanks', 'influencers', 'youtbers', 'probably', 'aggressive', 'suspect', 'agree', 'think', 'skateboarding', 'industry', 'would', 'come', 'blading', 'hard', 'blading', 'seen', 'copying', 'encroaching', 'turf']",241

I'm looking for an app that has a similar feature to endomondo's ""challenge"" feature.

1238,usd sway v razor genesys iii beginner setup,rollerblading,"Hey, I'm Looking to get back into skating and choosing a new skate, as I have USD Realms and don't like the way they feel. I'm looking for a skate for skatepark and that I can also cruise around the streets, so I was thinking of buying a boot only, as I can use the frames and wheels from my realms for the skatepark setup, and just have to buy a powerblading frame and wheels in the future.

After some research I was considering the USD SWAY (the Team 4, the 60 or the Montre), they seem like a versatile boot, with big souls on both positive and negative side (since I am going to be learning grinds, I think this might help) and since the boot is the same as the Powersilde Zoom (a freeskate Boot) I figure it should be good for bigger wheels as well.

While talking to a skate shop yesterday, they said that they won't be getting the montre's in my size and that the other sway's are only available as completes but that they have the Razors Genesys III for my size.

Now I ask for you expertise: Sways vs Genesys III, what do you recommend? are the Genesys good for cruising around in a powerblading setup? which of these are most beginner friendly? Are there any other boots you would recommend? My budget is ideally around 150 euros but I'm willing to go a bit over

Personally, I'm more inclined to the USD Sways, they seem more versatile, especially considering I haven't developed my skating style yet, but I'm very interested in your insights

BTW, I know shops like This Is Soul have the option of boot only for all skates, but I would I like to support shops in my country. The Sway Team 4 completes are 180 euro,  the Sway 60 are 170 (I'm not sure if these are on my size) and the Genesys III are 175 (boot only).

1276,fit help v aeon v zoom,rollerblading,"I just got some M12 Lo's in size 9 and I know they're supposed to be crazy tight, but it feels like the top of the toebox is straight up going to shear my toes off where the toebox meets the tongue, so I'm sending them back. I have plenty of room in the length, the width is super tight and has some hard pressure against the shell at the widest points (and my ankles), and the rest of it is crazy tight but is not actually painful like my toes/forefoot. So now I'm looking at either exchanging the M12's for a size 10 or getting the Aeon 60 Basic XXI's in 8/9.

My feet are 260/262 in mondo and my only other skates are Powerslide Zoom 80's in 8/9 (261-268). They felt perfect when they were new, but my feet are definitely on the small end for 8/9 and after breaking-in they are looser in the heel and ankle than I'd like. It's been fine for just cruising around town, but for aggressive skates I'd like to have more heel lock and support in the ankle. I'm worried that the Aeon's will fit like the Zoom's and I'll have a floppy heel and will have to drop a bunch of money on fancy liners to make them fit well.

My worry about sizing up for the M12's is that size 10 (280) sounds like they would be wayyyyy too long for my feet, especially since the 9's already have plenty of length. Without the liner in the M12's the ball of my foot hits the edge, but everything else has tons of space around it already.

I was really stoked for the M12's but I'm worried that going one size up will be too big, so I feel like the Aeon's are a safer choice since I kind of know what to expect. I mostly care about fit since these are my first aggressive skates and I'm not in a rush to be a grind king any time soon.

Anyone have experience with the difference in sizes for M12's? Or fit difference between Zoom's and Aeon's?",got lo size know supposed crazy tight feel like top toebox straight going shear toe toebox meet tongue sending back plenty room length width super tight hard pressure shell widest point ankle rest crazy tight actually painful like toe forefoot looking either exchanging size getting aeon basic xxi foot mondo skate powerslide zoom felt perfect new foot definitely small end breaking looser heel ankle like fine cruising around town aggressive skate like heel lock support ankle worried aeon fit like zoom floppy heel drop bunch money fancy liner make fit well worry sizing size sound like would wayyyyy long foot especially since already plenty length without liner ball foot hit edge everything else ton space around already really stoked worried going one size big feel like aeon safer choice since kind know expect mostly care fit since first aggressive skate rush grind king time soon anyone experience difference size fit difference zoom aeon,"['got', 'lo', 'size', 'know', 'supposed', 'crazy', 'tight', 'feel', 'like', 'top', 'toebox', 'straight', 'going', 'shear', 'toe', 'toebox', 'meet', 'tongue', 'sending', 'back', 'plenty', 'room', 'length', 'width', 'super', 'tight', 'hard', 'pressure', 'shell', 'widest', 'point', 'ankle', 'rest', 'crazy', 'tight', 'actually', 'painful', 'like', 'toe', 'forefoot', 'looking', 'either', 'exchanging', 'size', 'getting', 'aeon', 'basic', 'xxi', 'foot', 'mondo', 'skate', 'powerslide', 'zoom', 'felt', 'perfect', 'new', 'foot', 'definitely', 'small', 'end', 'breaking', 'looser', 'heel', 'ankle', 'like', 'fine', 'cruising', 'around', 'town', 'aggressive', 'skate', 'like', 'heel', 'lock', 'support', 'ankle', 'worried', 'aeon', 'fit', 'like', 'zoom', 'floppy', 'heel', 'drop', 'bunch', 'money', 'fancy', 'liner', 'make', 'fit', 'well', 'worry', 'sizing', 'size', 'sound', 'like', 'would', 'wayyyyy', 'long', 'foot', 'especially', 'since', 'already', 'plenty', 'length', 'without', 'liner', 'ball', 'foot', 'hit', 'edge', 'everything', 'else', 'ton', 'space', 'around', 'already', 'really', 'stoked', 'worried', 'going', 'one', 'size', 'big', 'feel', 'like', 'aeon', 'safer', 'choice', 'since', 'kind', 'know', 'expect', 'mostly', 'care', 'fit', 'since', 'first', 'aggressive', 'skate', 'rush', 'grind', 'king', 'time', 'soon', 'anyone', 'experience', 'difference', 'size', 'fit', 'difference', 'zoom', 'aeon']",153

&amp;#x200B;

I did a rockered setting 72 - 76 -76 -72

However here is the thing: I wear 3.5 Uk in shoes (35.5 in Eu size) and the consequence is that the front wheel and the back wheel are sticking out (like my boot front is aligned with the nut and ths rest of the wheel is going past that).

&amp;#x200B;

This used to be way worse with the stock 80mm wheels.

&amp;#x200B;

I can do crossovers (back/front), going backward, some transitions with them, but intricate moves, like for slalom seem IMPOSSIBLE.  😭

Most riders have their wheels and boots aligned and I have always wondered if my struggle could be related to that ... (especially when it comes to standing on heels/ toes etc...)  🤔  🤔

1320,roller blade attachment shoe,rollerblading,"Hi guys, I'm looking for advice if you know where to buy/how to make some attachment for shoes.

The main reason is for quick transportation. I'd get a backpack with attachment straps to carry my blades but they're heavy and putting them on/off takes time.

For example, I can't have roller blades on my feet in my subway, so, for a 5-10 minute ride, I have to spend that much time with changing...

I saw the Flaneurz ones, but they're skates and I'm not that good on skates. I also think they're not good in general for rough roads (pavement and such), or I'm just a beginner on them.

If I were to DIY some roller blade attachments, I'd also welcome suggestions for the snap-on system. I want to avoid big ugly straps (and go for Flaneurz style clip on), but I can't find anywhere those metal parts that go in the sole of the shoe... Also roller blades need way more ankle support than roller skates and I don't know if it's even possible

1322,fr boot size question,rollerblading,"

My pair of FR1 size 12 that I ordered arrived!  I am super excited for this upgrade from my K2 84 Pro's but I want to make sure I have the best possible fit for the lifetime of these skates and I am worried they will become too loose/packed out to the shell size over time.  I have done quite a bit of research and wish I could try them on side by side but there is limited availability of skates and some are preorder only atm.  My k2 11.5 fit great.

My feet measure 285 without socks and 290 with the socks I plan to continue to skate in.  I fit a US 11.5 normally but depending on brand I can be a 12.  I don't think I have ever fit a size 11 since I stopped growing and I only found one pair of footwear I own that was a size 11 and it was my Chaco Z1's.  I believe I have a wide toe box because my pinky toe will wear out the side of shoes when they get old especially if there is only mesh fabric instead of a tougher fabric where my pinky toe presses.  I chose the FR brand because they are suggested for those with wide feet and I was excited to learn and will always try to support companies founded by people that needed or wanted to provide a better product for everyone. :) 

The FR1 80 and new 90 shell as far as I can tell goes from 10-10.5(275-280) and 11.5-13.5(285-300mm).  The deluxe intuition FR1 80's have a size of 9.5-10 and 11.5-12(295-300) but have a different sizing chart.  Question #1 is my most important. 

1. (No liner test)Where do I place my foot in the boot when checking sizes without the liner?  Do I place my heel against the back plastic or place my arch where it feels most comfortable on the bottom of the boot?  If I place my heel touching the back plastic my arch does not line up and the boot is absurdly long.  If I place my arch where it feels good the boot is somewhat long but not nearly as bad as foot to the back.  With my foot lined up with the arch my toes almost touch the sides of the hard boot.  I am pretty sure I can go down in size in length but am really worried about the width.  Do the widths change a lot between shell sizes or is it mostly length?  I have seen a few size 10.5 and 11 folk have sized down but I have not seen anyone mention 11.5+.  Has anyone that has to wear &gt;11 US shoes tried to size down in the FR1's?  Will I be better off with the right width but too long or size down and most likely have to heat mold/ punch out the toe area width.  Can FR1's be punched out or does that toe bumper(guard?) On the side make that impossible? 

2. Did the split from Seba change any of the boot(not liner) sizes? Does year affect boot sizes? 

3.  The inline warehouse and fr1 website has a seperate size guide for the new deluxe FR1 and the regular FR1.  I assume the deluxe with intuition liner is a different size chart since the intuition liner is heat moldable and thinner than the FR1 standard liner?  Do the deluxe have the same shell size breakdown as the fr1 normal? 

4.  Are there any other differences between the FR1 80's and the new FR1 90's besides the frame and wheels?  Are there significant differences between the new deluxe fr1 80s and the fr180s 2018-2021 besides the v2 intuition liner and the v3 deluxe extruded aluminum vs 4d extruded aluminum frames?

I'm interested in urban rollerblading and I'm having a bit of trouble picking my rollerblade. I used to rollerblade and ice skate about 8 years ago and I can still ice skate confidently. I've been reading up on 3 vs 4 wheels and wheel sizes but I'm no quiet sure how many wheels would be optimal and what skate I should be getting.

I'm not too interested in tricks and if I were to develop an interest to them I'd rather get a pair of aggressive rollerblades later on. I'd be cruising around the city and I think manoeuvrability is going to be a bit more important than speed if that matters.   


Any suggestions on how many wheels and what skates I should get would be great. I've got a budget of maybe $600 and I can push it a bit but I'd rather stay a bit lower and get a bang for a buck rollerblade while not skimping on the quality. I'm a size us 9.5 generally

1332,actual price big wheel frame,rollerblading,"This post was in mind for a very long time. I came into inline skating in 2019. And first thing I discovered were quite high prices for skates / wheels / frames. Cherry on the cake were Wziard frame for 400USD. Second most expensive frame were Adapt frame for 130EUR.  
Time passed, Endless frames appeared for 180USD / Pair. Some time later: NN Skate frames.  
Somewhere between Wizards and Endless there were also a small project called Pragmatic Frames. They were for 200USD (because of that high price on Wizard, I suppose).  
So I went creatively, quite. And decided to build my own frame myself. Did spend some time learning how to use Fusion 360. Did read quite a lot information about how frames are made.  
So let's start with actual topic:  
I did research and found out that most of the frames are CNCed out of extruded aluminum profile.  
What does that mean? That means that factory has a machine that pushes aluminum thru matrix with desired gap (form) and there comes a long thing called a profile with special geometry ordered. There are plenty of factories that will make this out of your drawing. So I contacted one and sent them a drawing of profile, that can be used to produce frames starting with 76mm wheels and ending with 110mm. Wall thickness: 4mm, base thickness: 5mm (5mm thickness is must have for UFS frames).  
I made a profile that can be used for both: ufs and 165mm mounting.  
And I got the answer where they calculated the price for that profile to be produced.  
One of the pictures shows the profile itself and second shows the calculations from some german factory.  
Let's get right into calculations and translation of the text:  
Minimal order: 1000KG  
Price for meter / kg = 9.41EUR / 3.75EUR (11.60USD / 4.60USD)  
Tool production and machine setup: 1920EUR (2360USD)  
Minimal order X 3.75/KG = 3750EUR  
Minimal order + MAchinery = 5 670EUR (\~7000USD).  


Some logical calculations: 1000kg of this profile would approximately be equal to 300Meters of profile. Approximately.   
As 1 big wheel frame let's say 4x100 is 303mm long = 1 Meter of Profile equals 3 Frames.  
2 Meters of profile = 3 Pairs of frames (in profile).  


Now let's talk a bit about cutting the frames out of solid aluminum block.  
I ordered 20 pairs of my selfmade frame. Some people saw actual payslip for this order. I don't want to make this information open, so believe my words (or don't): Price for CNC milling 1 pair of frames out of solid block + anodize = \~110USD (in terms of ordering 20 pairs, price goes even lower when you order more). Price for ordering a single pair is 365EUR (inc. VAT) (450USD) (Yeah, milling a single part of Wizard frame for yourself would be more expensive as buying original one).  
Also, here you have the ACTUAL price for Wizard Frame prototype.  


Let's return to extruded profiles. Now we know that it costs \~55USD to mill a single frame from a single solid aluminum block. Quite a work to do for CNC mill, tbh.   
Now I would like to show you the simulation vid that can be found on youtube, how are frames CNCed out of aluminum profile:   
[https://youtu.be/DCBDavg2Bpg](https://youtu.be/DCBDavg2Bpg)  


As you can see, only few tools are used. So... that would take less time, less setup, less tools and less actual work to make a frame out of profile. Here I lack on information, but it would ASSUMINGLY be less than 10EUR / Part. Let's say 12USD (which is total overkill, but whatever).  
3 Pairs of frames (in profile) would cost 9.41EUR x 2 Meters = 19.82EUR (25USD).  
25USD / 3 pairs = 8.33USD / Pair.  
And here we come to result: 8.33+24 (12 x 2 for milling).

Production price of a Frame pair = 32.33USD. Add something for anodize. Add something for spraying the company logo and frame name on it = \~40USD / Pair.   


One BUT: You have to order 300 meters of that profile. And also 300 meters = 450 PAIRS. Do all the rest calculations yourself.

I won't be blaming any company for obviously overpriced products. I am just giving you answers you probably don't even need. Or... maybe you do?  
Btw... there is a small company from Chech Republic called Tempish. They sell their frames for \~50EUR. They also have interesting frame called Tempish CAT 80/110 (4x80 or 3x110).

Next question is about overcoming fear. I feel like I'm afraid to try stuff and push myself for fear of falling. I have all the protection. I fall plenty, so I know I'll be alright.

1357,axle smooth bolt completely stuck,rollerblading," 

I have flying eagle skates, and the front and back have [rockerable axles](https://www.inlinewarehouse.com/Flying_Eagle_Replacement/descpage-FEAXLE.html).   
The smooth side (not the hex wrench side) is stuck. When I unscrew a little and push from the other side like I normally do to take it out, it pushes at the inside of the frame. It seems like something is misaligned. I've tried everything I can think of, including a mallet, sticking a smaller allen wrench all the way through, and wedging a flat head in between the wheel and frame, but nothing seems to work.  

What most likely caused this problem is when I tightened it last time, I saw the bolt wouldn't lie flush against the frame. I kept screwing it in because I noticed it eventually drew the smooth side flat against the frame. 

Unfortunately my bearing in that wheel seized up. So unless I can unseize it without removing it, or I guess buy a totally new frame, I won't be able to use this skate.

I recently got a pair of THEM 909s. The shell is seems to be fine, however i’m not sure if i have enough room in the liner. 

The liner feels tight on the top of my foot. It’s a 25-25.5cm liner and i know my perfect fit is 25.7cm for powerslide skates with built in liners. To put it into context, the new liners feel like a tight hug around around the space in the middle of my toes and heel. 

my feet are 25.5cm. 

My questions come as a result. 

1. I feel like i’m between sizes. does it make sense to get a slightly bigger liner in the same size shell? or should i expect the liner to ware in. 

2. can i heat mold the liner, and if it’s still not working...exchange it? don’t want to ruin the boot. 

Let me know what you think. thanks for your time.",hey team another sizing question recently got pair shell seems fine however sure enough room liner liner feel tight top foot cm liner know perfect fit cm powerslide skate built liner put context new liner feel like tight hug around around space middle toe heel foot cm question come result feel like size make sense get slightly bigger liner size shell expect liner ware heat mold liner still working exchange want ruin boot let know think thanks time,"['hey', 'team', 'another', 'sizing', 'question', 'recently', 'got', 'pair', 'shell', 'seems', 'fine', 'however', 'sure', 'enough', 'room', 'liner', 'liner', 'feel', 'tight', 'top', 'foot', 'cm', 'liner', 'know', 'perfect', 'fit', 'cm', 'powerslide', 'skate', 'built', 'liner', 'put', 'context', 'new', 'liner', 'feel', 'like', 'tight', 'hug', 'around', 'around', 'space', 'middle', 'toe', 'heel', 'foot', 'cm', 'question', 'come', 'result', 'feel', 'like', 'size', 'make', 'sense', 'get', 'slightly', 'bigger', 'liner', 'size', 'shell', 'expect', 'liner', 'ware', 'heat', 'mold', 'liner', 'still', 'working', 'exchange', 'want', 'ruin', 'boot', 'let', 'know', 'think', 'thanks', 'time']",78

1370,seeking advice wrong,rollerblading,"Its been a very long since I've been on skates, but since the *fat man in the red suit* brought my daughter some new skates I thought I'd get myself some to go skating with her.

I picked up a pair of K2 Kinetic 80 skates from a local store.  Without naming names, they're the kind of store that usually deals in used sporting goods, but they also sold these K2s new. Since these were the only skates in the store my size, and they felt fine enough when I tried them on, I took them home.

After a few short skating sessions, I feel like something is wrong. I know to expect some discomfort from using muscles like this for the first time in years, but that's not what this is.  When I stand in them, it feels like the wheels start leaning to the outside of my foot, like I have to bring my knees together to stand comfortably without the skates leaning.  When I'm doing a simple glide forward, it feels like I'm having to consciously correct myself so as to not ride on the outside of the front wheels... if that makes any sense.  To me, it feels like the front of the blade need to be shifted towards the outside of the skate, but these are not adjustable in any way.

I don't know if the issue is my posture or form, but I don't remember having these sorts of issues all those years ago.

I don't know what to do.  I can't return them, since they've been worn. I can sell them back and take a loss.  It'll be less of a loss if I take store credit, but it'll be store credit at a store with essentially no in-store options to replace them.  Maybe changing the insole/footbed would help, but with how it feels, I think it would have to be one heck of a wedge shaped piece to correct this issue.

I don't exactly remember what I last wore.  I know they were Rollerblade brand, but its been about 20 years.

1457,right skate learn basic powerslide imperial one,rollerblading,"Hello, I'm looking for some advice. 

I used to skate a lot as a kid, but I consider myself new at skating. At the moment i'm learning the T stop, basic tricks (jumps), crossover etc.   
I bought myself an urban skate, Powerslide Imperial one 80 (ABEC 7, 80mm 85A spinner wheels, ), but I'm not sure if this is the (beginner?) skate that i'm looking for. 

I'm 25, 1m58 tall and very lightweight. It feels as if this skate is a too heavy for me.  For example, when I make jumps it feels as if I can't get my feet off the ground . Even lifting one feet across the other one (crossover) feels heavy. I'm not sure if this is just me lacking the strength to make it work or if it's the skate. Since i'm a beginner i don't have the 'skate muscles' but it feels as if there's something wrong, as if the skate is 'too difficult' and it would be a great skate in the future when I'm more advanced and have developed some 'skate muscles' ... but I'm not sure about the issue. 

I'm also struggling with 'feeling in control/balanced' on my 80mm wheels. I wonder if a freeskate with smaller wheels or maybe an aggressive skate would make me feel more safe. I have this 'too high from the surface to learn tricks and stops' feeling but i'm also not sure if it's just anxiety / a feeling I must get used too, or if a smaller wheel would really help me into learning all of the basics.

Would I be better off with a very lightweight freeskate with small wheels, if yes, which one?   
I want to be able to go for a ride on the street but I also want to be able to go to the skate park. I've had injuries on my feet in the past so i really need a skate that offers a lot of stability and protection.

1483,done mizou front lab help save world,rollerblading,"A few years ago in late 2014 I did a Mizou on a small wall a few hundred metres from my home. I had just started blading and couldn't do many grinds. The wall was shin high and freshly build right in front of a new big building. It's right across the hospital so I thought that it would have to be some medical facility. Smooth concrete and at the end someone had already waxed a couple of feed. I did a few pathetic low speed Mizous and thought to myself ""on day skating cool street obstacles will feel natural"". It was next to a busy street so after a couple of minutes I left. As it's really close to my home and on the way to the inner city I've passed this spot daily. Mostly by bus.
Not long after they out a fence on the wall. It seems like this was planned all along and the wall was just the foundation for the fence. You could still see the waxed spot. Across the years I'd tell friends about it and how it was skateable once. Just another spot that disappeared.

Now this fence got replaced by a high security fence. And the building is known across the world. The building is a lab and it's called BioNTech.

Some of the other ones hardly loosen or tighten as all as if the tool isn’t doing anything. Basically, they’re all uneven and it’s making me pull my hair out.

If you think I’m barking up the wrong tree, I’d be grateful for alternative skate suggestions.

1509,tri skate recommendation please,rollerblading,"I haven’t posted in this sub before so I hope I’m in the right place. My wife and I had rollerblades as  teenagers and I’m 32 now. I’ve been long boarding consistently since college. I just bought my wife some Powerslides and now I want some! 

We both have sorta wide feet...I guess. Not terribly wide, we just try to avoid shoes that squeeze our toes together. She has some hot spots in her Phuzion Radons, but she really likes them, they aren’t fully broken in, and we ordered a boot stretcher, so hopefully that helps. 

I’m not sure exactly what model or brand I want. I love the Powerslide technology (probably because they have good marketing) so I’m leaning towards the Swell Lite 100. 

Here’s my checklist: tri skate, 90-110mm wheels, fitness/distance, somewhat rough roads, airflow, sub-$300, and I would prefer a decent sized toe box, but I could compromise for the right skate.

I've got an ancient (circa the 90s) pair of roces I picked up off eBay ages ago, but they're kind of wearing out.

That said, the selection of skates I've been able to try on has been super small, but I'm reluctant to just try my luck online. Do you all have any pointers?

1571,update kizer element ufs frame,rollerblading,"Speed: Compared to a flat 80mm frame (and for someone who never experienced bigger wheels than 80s), the additional speed really felt amazing. Riding the Sebas with the stock frame felt really tiring at times (esp. over longer distances), not with the new frames as they kept the speed for far longer and also felt astonishingly light (probably because the Seba Deluxe frames are built like tanks and therefore not really on the light side). They also offered a significantly more comfortable ride on rough surfaces (great when your town centre is all cobble stone).

Maneuverability: The rocker felt great, it didn't diminish the stability at higher speeds, but made the frame feel quite nimble, when attempting ""wizard moves"" or riding through an urban environment (I did feel the added length of the frame, but in a rather positive way). I was afraid crossovers could be a problem, but I got used to it pretty much right away.

Stability: As mentioned before, the frames felt stable at higher speeds. I didn't experience speed wobbles when bombing hills and the added frame length really gave me confidence to go fast. 

All in all I'm very happy with the new frames and really had a blast skating them.

I assumed the groove was exactly like the K2 Unnatural frame, but it looks slightly deeper. It also appears it's a very slight Hi-Lo setup as the inner wheels bolts are slightly lower than the outer ones  (this is possibly negated with the 6mm axel rocker option though) .

1652,tip easing front back transition,rollerblading,"First, let me explain where I'm coming from. I got into rollerblading during the initial lockdown and was hooked pretty much instantly. I must've been skating for about a week while I was practicing front to back transitions in a parking lot, which was way too early to even be doing stuff like that in hindsight, but things were going well and I got overconfident. Lost my balance after landing backwards during one such practice session and took a really hard smack on the concrete, which ended up breaking one of my wrists. This is entirely on me because I wasn't wearing any kind of wrist protection. 


Anyway, this was back in April and I've been back on my skates since a month or so, all kitted up this time. I've been having enough fun just skating around, but I'm getting the itch to start practicing more technical stuff again. I'm trying things very slowly and I've looked at a bunch of videos for easy, albeit less effective, beginner techniques for these transitions. The accident, however, has left me with a huge mental block whenever I even consider attempting any of them.


What I'm ultimately getting at here is: Are there any ways I can easy myself into transitions without necessarily having to practice the transitions themselves? I'm thinking of techniques that might enhance my general agility and confidence on skates, so when it does come to practicing transitions I'll be able to tackle them without too much fear of taking another smack, stuff like that.

I’m sure this question gets asked regularly but I did my best to search for a pinned answer and was not able to find one. 

Can you all help a complete newbie like me by pointing me in the direction of some great websites and maybe even provide some guidance on what blades to purchase? 

We want to get some blades that aren’t necessarily the cheapest but rather the best value and something we can grow into as this passion inevitably snowballs. 

Thank you all for your help in advance and apologies again if this question has gotten boring to all you professionals.

1661,could little help buying skate anyone familiar powerslide phuzion radon,rollerblading,"So I've taken the little one roller-skating a couple of times and I've really enjoyed rollerblading - enough to warrant getting my own skates. Used to be a pretty competent ice skater over 20 years ago and would love to get into inline skating.

The other kind is available at the only decent 'local' (90 min drive) skate shop: https://extremeskates.com.au/inline-skates/mens-rollerblades/powerslide-skates-phuzion-radon-80-black/

Has anyone used the powerslide phuzion radon 80's before? I hear great things about the RFX 80s but I want to be able to go to a brick-and-mortar store so was wondering if there's much between them.

Soon to be blader(well return to, haven't done it since I was a kid going up and down the kitchen floor) So I've been watching the street/urban bladers and kind of already decided hey I wanna do that  cause that seems like fun taking a day trip to downtown norfolk(I'm in Virginia by the way) just to skate around and explore the city. so my train of thought is, even though I can buy fitness skates as they're a good starter, I figured if I'm going to be street skating I'm going to be jumping off things and on things and feel like fitness skates won't hold up. So I've been doing some research I'm between the FR line or the rollerblade Cruisers what I've read on the twisted edge line and from the videos I've seen its to much work to get them to fit right without causing sore spots so for a beginner between the FR line and the Cruisers what would you guys reccomend?

1799,speedskater carbon frame extra rigid longer frame flex,rollerblading,"To experienced speedskaters reading this, what are your thoughts: I am an occasional speed/long distance skater (usually free-skating), but I had the opportunity to build a custom carbon frame, and chose a 11.5"" that fits both 110mm and 125mm wheels (with an extra 5mm spacer between boot and frame for 125mm). To compensate the relative shortness of the frame for 125mm (I thought 11.5"" was perfect for 110 though), we decided with the manufacturer to use the most rigid carbon available.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, usual carbon frames always have some extra flex (thick aluminium frames are more rigid) which allows extra grip and maneuverability in curves. With the custom build I have, the extra rigidity could compensate the extra shortness, even more with very hard wheels. What are your thoughts on that?

&amp;#x200B;

I would classify myself as a novice skater. I've been skating for about a year, but quite casually. I currently own a pair of K2 Fit Boa 84 fitness skates. They fit decently, are a 'soft' boot, and I'm in love with the boa lacing system.  


I'm not quite ready to chow down on some new skates yet. I still need to master stopping properly and a few other transitional movements, then I'm jumping my wheels up to 90mm. I can slide a bit but not really power stop, I haven't practiced slalom at all, and I REALLY need to work on my core strength. My tummy out of shape, y'all. I mainly do urban/commuter skating, no fancy tricks or park stunts.  


What I'm looking for is some advice on upgrading in the next year or so. I don't think my current skates are moddable in any way (frame swapping, etc.) What I'd really like some advice on:  
1. Soft vs. hard boots (I live in the humid swamp-ass south, breathability is needed)  
2. 4 wheels vs. 3 (Current skate is 4)  
3. I really want modability (frame swapping, etc.)  
4. Boa lacing isn't a must, but gee whiz, do I love it. If I have to forgo boa, why should I? What are its cons, etc.?   
5. Durability and power transfer. Again, I'm asking about boots primarily, but if there's a full package that fits close to my needs, what would that be?  
6. Are there any other considerations I'm missing or other information that would be helpful?  


I've tried looking all across the net to find information, and I think I'm more overwhelmed at this point than informed. There are so many conflicting opinions and gurus out there that espouse particular things, like 3 over 4 wheels, aggressive frames, etc. I want some simple recommendations based on experience and use, especially regarding comfort and power transfer, and modability.   


On a lesser note unrelated to boots. Ceramic bearings? I hear so many good things about them, especially how long they last. If I'm not doing aggressive park skating, would ceramics be good?  


Thanks so much in advance for any advice and recommendations. If you need any other information or specifics, feel free to ask. I love skating and want to get into it more, and while I'm happy with my current skates, I know I'll outpace them soon enough. I want something GREAT, not just good or passable.

I think I've settled on the CJ carbon as my next skate but i'm torn on sizing. I have done some searching and found lots of sizing advice on the Seba CJ plastic, but not much on the carbon model.

1831,rockering radius,rollerblading,"I've recently done some research and found out that rockering wasn't invented by inline skaters :). In fact, *every* ice skate blade has some amount of rockering that is expressed in radius (instead of height). Typical radii range from 2-3 meters (hockey),  through 10 meters (short track speedskates), up to 25 meters (long track speedskates).

I've figured out a simplified formula to translate radius ho height:

h=(l\^2)/(2\*R)

or

R=(l\^2)/(2\*h),

where ""R"" is rocker radius, ""h"" is rocker height, ""l"" is distance from frame center to wheel axle.

Let's try to calculate the radius of a typical 243mm banana rockered skate:

R=(122\^2)/(2\*2)=3721mm, which is a typical hockey/figure skate radius

Now, say, I want to go short track with my 4x90 273mm skates:

h=(137\^2)/(10000\*2)=0,94mm, that's a typical ""magician""/""natural"" rocker height.

Inline speed skaters seem to not use any rockering at all, but if they would they would likely set their huge 4\*110 335mm frames to 25 meter radius:

h=(168\^2)/(25000\*2)=0.56mm

1832,bladed since last weekend go like hoped demoralized ever since skate cuz feel like skate think need experienced input warning long winded paragraph,rollerblading,"(Pictures of the blades I bought @ bottom of post)  


So, i'm a 26 year old guy.  Healthy as normal (no physical conditions), 5' 9"", around 170lb, and decent stamina.  I don't exactly work out, but i'm not ""weak"" either.  I used to play with my older sister's rollerblades very often when I was really young, and the last time I wore a pair of blades was when I was 12.  And I vividly remember it feeling quite natural to me; can't even remember falling.  Granted it was on level/flat ground, but still.  I feel like my center of balance is just as good as it was when I was younger, if not any better, so I feel like I have no reasons to suspect that I shouldn't still be fully capable of doing this rollerblading thing at least close to the same level I was when I was young.  I just need to ease my body into it, that's all.  


Recently i'd come across a lot of rollerblading videos that I ended up binging (including tutorials and tip videos on proper technique), and not only did so many of their skates look so cool and appealing to me visually, it also reminded me of that natural feeling I had \~15 yrs ago.  So I decided that, once the pandemic got under control, I would get into blading again.  So I started searching for a pair of inline skates: I knew right from the getgo that I especially want to have a pair of white skates, or (even better) white/blue.  The closest thing I could find to that (in a sea of otherwise all-black skates...) was this pre-owned (yet decent-looking) pair with the Airwalk brand for around $60-70.  These are ""Size 9"", and I wear a 10.5 US.  And as far as i'm aware, Airwalk is an american company (correct me if i'm wrong).  They're not exactly what i'm looking for, but they were the closest shot I could find.  And plus I figured that I could just replace the boot later anyways, since I remember the skates that my sister had were customizable (found out later that what I bought was non-customizable whatsoever...).  


Right after first trying them on in my room, immediately I felt like the wheel frames were ever-so-slightly... 'crooked', let's say?  They feel like they're somewhat tilted inward.  It makes balancing on them a chore, without having the outer sides of my feet veering over the frames; in order to get the wheels upright/parallel with my body, i'd have to bow-leg my knees, which also means putting stress on the sides of my lower legs.  Totally 100% not ideal.  So right from the getgo they felt.... well, 'wrong' is the only way I can describe it when comparing to how I felt being in a pair of blades when I was 12.  But I ignored this, because I thought I just needed to actually try them out on some asphalt or concrete first, instead of dismissing them as if I *didn't* just spend over 60 bucks.  


So I waited until the weekend for it to get sunnier (the best weather i'm gonna get for quiiiite a while now...), and I took them to this playground w/ a small jogging track that's a little over 5 mins from where I live.  Middle of the day and nobody else around; perfect place for me to practice.  So I try to start getting a stride going... and I simply COULD NOT maintain a stride past like 3 steps with these.  I honestly do not ever remember having this much trouble doing this 15 yrs ago.  Everything felt so wrong.  After I ended up having a fall, I decided to just go back to my car and I just sat there wondering as I took them off if it was really just me?  Surely not all skates are like this, right...?  Have skates always felt crooked like this? Were all of those handful of skating memories I had as a kid just a lie?  Or did I just conveniently forget what it was really like?  Do I return these skates?  Do I keep trying to make it work?  Am I just ""past my prime"" because I wasted the past 8 years of my life being inactive?  No way man, i'm only 26 fucking years old, how could that possibly be it? Those were just some of the thoughts I had as I was trying to come to grips with myself about what to do next.  There was a whole lot of self-doubt and unproductive indecision involved, because I felt like a whole chunk of my childhood had just been immediately contradicted in the span of like 15 minutes.  Needless to say I was left with a pretty sunken heart when I got home.  


After trying them on for size again a few more times, I ultimately concluded that it'd just be best for me to return them to the person I bought them from (and I can only hope they'll actually accept them back...  as of writing this I have a feeling they won't) and look for a different kind of pair.  I initially chose this pair solely because of their visuals, i.e. the colorway.  I *really* really want a pair of white or white/blue skates, but it seems like everywhere I look that isn't kid's skates, it's all solid dark colors.  And I get that, I understand *why* it's like that, because it means you don't have to clean asphalt scrapes &amp; scuffs on them.  I just still wish it wasn't so hard to find skates with the kind of colorway(s) I like.  


So basically I wanted to ask what you guys think, if these skates look messed up to you or not?  I'm still (intending on) returning them either way, I just want to see whether or not i'm wrong about them being messed up.

I ask this question because I got a pair of FRX 80’s in September of this year (2020). I have been skating them HARD and OFTEN. I’ve already got a new set (RB Hydrogens) of wheels after beating the stock set to hell. 

My bearings haven’t been spinning *quite* like they used to. 

My liner’s lace eyelets have rusted, as well as the eyelets on the shell. They were so rusted they tore up my first set of laces, and I just bought a new set of black waxed laces.

I skate hard, so my boot and frames are pretty beaten up. 

I know a lot of the things listed (Bearings, Wheels, Laces) are consumables that must be replaced often. But are my skates themselves going to have to be replaced soon?

If not, how do I extend their longevity? I just got into skating so I’m not super informed on maintenance. I really appreciate any input, friends.

1857,advice aggressive inline,rollerblading,"Hi,

I have been doing aggressive inline for a few months and started doing the 365 day skate challenge (57 days in). I started actually practicing/learning grinds at the start of the challenge (avoided grinding before this). So far I can consistently do:

\- makio, mizou, soul, frontside, 180s, 360s (kind of, not from high places)

\- makio, mizou, soul 180 out

And less consistently but can accomplish with ample effort and time:

\- inspin and outspin (way less consistent than inspin) freestyle makio

\- frontside 270 out

\- toe rolls (at least 2-3 seconds)

\- unity cess slides

\- acid grinds (kinda)

I've been curious to hear from anyone who has more experience than me whether or not my progress for 57 days is decent. (I skate alone, don't see other rollerbladers often so I don't have much context). I imagine it may be kind of hard to judge based off a list, so if anyone is curious my insta is @ tom0c for videos. I am also wondering if people have any tips for how to get good **fast**.

1914,fitting diagnose pain hard v soft boot,rollerblading,"Am trying on two skates. Both feel fine on feet. There's no pressure points, toes aren't cramped, foot isn't sliding around.
 
These are my first skates (in a LONG time) and am trying on hardwood at home / in a gym.
 
Skate 1) Powerslide One Zoom Pro 100. Hard boot. Doesn't feel like anything on my foot. Maybe a slight hot spot just behind the ankle bone on the inside of each foot - halfway between the ankle and heel. Accelerates well, turns easy, stops OK - well, that's just me!
 
Skate 2) Powerslide Phuzion Argon 90. Soft boot.
 
First use; wore both skates for 10 minutes and skated around the house for 10 minutes. Felt like my foot alternated between flopping outward over the wheels or inboard of them--much like it feels when wearing ice skates. They didn't feel BAD.
 
Second use; wore both skates for 10 minutes in a gym, Zoom Pro first Phuzion second. This was shortly after an hour of cross country skiing. Sharp pains in my right foot at the arch with the Phuzions and a bit in the left also. They didn't really feel less supportive, just painful. If  anything, the footbed felt tipped UP on the inner part [the arch] of the skate.
 
3rd use; both skates for 10 minutes skating around the house. Recently finished 2 hours of cross country skiing. The Zoom Pro felt normal, a little constricting but had been tightened more over the foot arch than before. The Phuzion didn't create any pain under the foot in the arch like before but had a dull radiating pain in the top of the left foot directly over the arch and perhaps a tiny bit of tenderness at that spot just after removing them.
 
So, I'm not experienced in the slightest. Internet educated at best. So the terms that keep coming up in discussion as I read about the differences in hard/soft boots is the level of supportiveness of the boot. I classic and skate cross country and occasionally ice skate also (more poorly) and this is a whole different game of boot fit. Also downhill rarely. Anyway, I would have thought the soft boot would ""mold"" to the foot right away and that it wouldn't bring ankle rigidity on its own--the wearer would need those muscles. I figured that wouldn't be a problem. But that's not what it felt like. The hard boot feels like it's more shaped to my foot, and that it's absent most of the strange pains of the soft boot.
 
Any thoughts? I figure I'll just keep the zoom pro and return the phuzion but I'd actually like to be able to explain WHY the experience was this way to get a better fit on any future skate purchases I make. Again, they both FIT my foot fine but after trying to use them for a pretty brief period it was apparent that one just wasn't working for me and I'm not sure why.",trying two skate feel fine foot pressure point toe cramped foot sliding around first skate long time trying hardwood home gym skate powerslide one zoom pro hard boot feel like anything foot maybe slight hot spot behind ankle bone inside foot halfway ankle heel accelerates well turn easy stop ok well skate powerslide phuzion argon soft boot first use wore skate minute skated around house minute felt like foot alternated flopping outward wheel inboard much like feel wearing ice skate feel bad second use wore skate minute gym zoom pro first phuzion second shortly hour cross country skiing sharp pain right foot arch phuzions bit left also really feel le supportive painful anything footbed felt tipped inner part arch skate rd use skate minute skating around house recently finished hour cross country skiing zoom pro felt normal little constricting tightened foot arch phuzion create pain foot arch like dull radiating pain top left foot directly arch perhaps tiny bit tenderness spot removing experienced slightest internet educated best term keep coming discussion read difference hard soft boot level supportiveness boot classic skate cross country occasionally ice skate also poorly whole different game boot fit also downhill rarely anyway would thought soft boot would mold foot right away bring ankle rigidity wearer would need muscle figured problem felt like hard boot feel like shaped foot absent strange pain soft boot thought figure keep zoom pro return phuzion actually like able explain experience way get better fit future skate purchase make fit foot fine trying use pretty brief period apparent one working sure,"['trying', 'two', 'skate', 'feel', 'fine', 'foot', 'pressure', 'point', 'toe', 'cramped', 'foot', 'sliding', 'around', 'first', 'skate', 'long', 'time', 'trying', 'hardwood', 'home', 'gym', 'skate', 'powerslide', 'one', 'zoom', 'pro', 'hard', 'boot', 'feel', 'like', 'anything', 'foot', 'maybe', 'slight', 'hot', 'spot', 'behind', 'ankle', 'bone', 'inside', 'foot', 'halfway', 'ankle', 'heel', 'accelerates', 'well', 'turn', 'easy', 'stop', 'ok', 'well', 'skate', 'powerslide', 'phuzion', 'argon', 'soft', 'boot', 'first', 'use', 'wore', 'skate', 'minute', 'skated', 'around', 'house', 'minute', 'felt', 'like', 'foot', 'alternated', 'flopping', 'outward', 'wheel', 'inboard', 'much', 'like', 'feel', 'wearing', 'ice', 'skate', 'feel', 'bad', 'second', 'use', 'wore', 'skate', 'minute', 'gym', 'zoom', 'pro', 'first', 'phuzion', 'second', 'shortly', 'hour', 'cross', 'country', 'skiing', 'sharp', 'pain', 'right', 'foot', 'arch', 'phuzions', 'bit', 'left', 'also', 'really', 'feel', 'le', 'supportive', 'painful', 'anything', 'footbed', 'felt', 'tipped', 'inner', 'part', 'arch', 'skate', 'rd', 'use', 'skate', 'minute', 'skating', 'around', 'house', 'recently', 'finished', 'hour', 'cross', 'country', 'skiing', 'zoom', 'pro', 'felt', 'normal', 'little', 'constricting', 'tightened', 'foot', 'arch', 'phuzion', 'create', 'pain', 'foot', 'arch', 'like', 'dull', 'radiating', 'pain', 'top', 'left', 'foot', 'directly', 'arch', 'perhaps', 'tiny', 'bit', 'tenderness', 'spot', 'removing', 'experienced', 'slightest', 'internet', 'educated', 'best', 'term', 'keep', 'coming', 'discussion', 'read', 'difference', 'hard', 'soft', 'boot', 'level', 'supportiveness', 'boot', 'classic', 'skate', 'cross', 'country', 'occasionally', 'ice', 'skate', 'also', 'poorly', 'whole', 'different', 'game', 'boot', 'fit', 'also', 'downhill', 'rarely', 'anyway', 'would', 'thought', 'soft', 'boot', 'would', 'mold', 'foot', 'right', 'away', 'bring', 'ankle', 'rigidity', 'wearer', 'would', 'need', 'muscle', 'figured', 'problem', 'felt', 'like', 'hard', 'boot', 'feel', 'like', 'shaped', 'foot', 'absent', 'strange', 'pain', 'soft', 'boot', 'thought', 'figure', 'keep', 'zoom', 'pro', 'return', 'phuzion', 'actually', 'like', 'able', 'explain', 'experience', 'way', 'get', 'better', 'fit', 'future', 'skate', 'purchase', 'make', 'fit', 'foot', 'fine', 'trying', 'use', 'pretty', 'brief', 'period', 'apparent', 'one', 'working', 'sure']",260

1947,recommendation pair skate,rollerblading,"Hello!
I am a student from Germany and I know how to skate since I was a small kid, but only did it once in a while. However, I started taking it more seriously when the pandemic started and now it is my only real workout. I normally skate on my [K2 Power 80s](https://www.skatepro.com/119-20522.htm) for 20km to 30km on bike paths, in parks, and rarely on empty streets.
I kind of want to replace my old skates, because I feel like I am outgrowing them and because they aren't made for longer distances (skating Marathons is a longterm goal of mine).

I did some research in the last days and now I am obsessed with the Idea of using Triskates even though I have only yet skated 4x80mm. Having bigger wheels without a frame that is too long sounds great. I'm still very uncertain so I decided to ask this sub and maybe get some helpful replies.

Skates I have been considering (favorite to least favorite, information about myself below):

2. [Rollerblade Macroblade 100 3wd 3WD](https://rollerblade.com/deutschland/produkte/macroblade-100-3wd-3) - They might be the best skates on this list, but a little bit too expensive. Also, I don't know where to buy them. 3x100mm, 220€ - 240€

3.[Roces Gymnasium 2.0 TIF](https://www.skatepro.com/119-34128.htm) - Seems to be a solid pair of skates, but aren't exactly what I am looking for. 4x90mm, 200€

4. [Tempish Blax Top](https://www.skatepro.com/119-38251.htm) - These were my favorites at first, but I'm not sure if I am good enough to skate these yet. 3x110mm, 200€

I don't know enough about skates to decide which one is the best. New suggestions would be incredibly helpful. If my choices are terrible, please let me know. Thanks for helping!

I recently got myself a new pair of freeride skates, the [Micro MT3](https://www.micro-skate.com/product/mt3/). They are very similar to the MT Plus, but with 45° straps instead of buckles.

First idea is to add my own cushion to the liner, but it would have to be just right. Can't be either too soft or to hard. Another idea would be to use insoles, but there are no skate specific insoles available where I live.

I am wearing the blades around the house, and there is no pain at all and they don't feel super loose. But before I wear them out to really test them, how do I know if they fit snug enough?

I've done some online research, which seems just to say ""check your toe is just about to touch the end, and make sure your heel doesn't wiggle"" - check to both of these!

However, my foot isn't completely isolated, I can wiggle a little bit, sort of around the ball of my feet - but not much. I do feel secure-ish - but how do I know?

2058,brand model recommendation based criterion,rollerblading,"Hi all! I'm a beginner looking to buy my first skates. Shoutout to u/Dr_Ulator who provided a really thorough comment on another beginner's post -- your message really streamlined my research and was such a helpful place to start. So thank you! Hoping I can take advantage of your/other people's kindness to ask some follow-up questions...

&amp;#x200B;

I concluded that I probably need 4 wheels, 80-90mm, and likely recreation or fitness skates. I'll mainly be on roads or paved trails, if I'm lucky enough to find some. I'll definitely want a heel brake to start.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a beginner, but decently athletic, and I've rollerbladed casually in the distant past, so I'm familiar with the absolute basics. I'd like to eventually learn how to do some tricks (but not jumps), so I'm a bit torn about a soft vs. hard boot. Thoughts? I'm a woman and 5'7"", if that makes a difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Even with some of these criteria determined, I am at a total loss. There are SO MANY brands, so many styles, that I'm just completely overwhelmed. Are there any brands or models that you guys might recommend given my needs? Or ones to avoid? (So far I've seen a few thumbs up to Seba E3 80 Freestyle for beginners, and a thumbs down to Impala unless you're mostly just interested in a basic comfy skate that looks cute.) Budget isn't a huge consideration, within reason; I don't mind buying something expensive if it's built well. But maybe beginners typically buy a cheap pair to start anyway, since they'll grow out of them..??

The biggest problem is my inside foot doesn't want to stay in front. I can't figure out what to do with my feet to keep that inside food in the front. My most successful turns have all devolved into the outside foot being in the front.

If it's relevant, I still can't scissor while I'm coasting, either. When I try to scissor, I end up drifting to the side. Maybe I'm rushing into the turning without having the basics down?

2085,supination ankle pain help,rollerblading,"Tl;dr I have supination problems and whenever I search for solutions all I can find are solutions for pronation. Help?

I have the rare problem of naturally supinating rather than pronating. Since I got my skates this summer (Swell Lite 100), they have always dug into the inner ankle bone on my right ankle. For some reason, my left ankle is fine and the left skate fits like a dream in general, feels great. In the first week or so, I shifted my frames as far to the outsides of the boots as I could, and that immediately helped with the general supination problem, although it didn't fix it completely (good form is necessary for that, which I just had to learn over time). 

At first, I thought it was the hard plastic part that comes around the heel (bottom/side of the boot) that was digging into my ankle bone. Reason being, I always ha r bruising mostly on the bottom of that bone, but the whole bone gets red. There isn't ever a blister forming, even after 4+ hours, so I know it's just pressure from something, not rubbing. Upon further investigation this week (just poking around with my fingers really), I'm actually thinking it's the cuff, not the bottom section of the boot. I've tried loosening the top cuff to varying degrees, even to the point of feeling unstable, and yet even with them on that loose, once I'm out skating there is intense pressure on that bone.

I've read recently that insoles with better arch support can take pressure off of that area, but when I read that it was in the context of *pronation* problems. So I am a little confused/wary... does anyone else have this problem? Think insoles will help?

Eventually I'm going to have to take a good amount of time off to let my ankle heal completely. The last time I took a full week off though, it still wasn't 100% healed (I heal slow usually. Even small scratches can take longer than a week sometimes). This may be inevitable with the dead of winter coming anyway... but even so, after it heals, I'll just have the same problem getting back to it. I really don't want to have to get entirely new skates either at the moment just to fix this, so I thought I'd see if anyone here has advice first.",tl dr supination problem whenever search solution find solution pronation help rare problem naturally supinating rather pronating since got skate summer swell lite always dug inner ankle bone right ankle reason left ankle fine left skate fit like dream general feel great first week shifted frame far outside boot could immediately helped general supination problem although fix completely good form necessary learn time first thought hard plastic part come around heel bottom side boot digging ankle bone reason always ha r bruising mostly bottom bone whole bone get red ever blister forming even hour know pressure something rubbing upon investigation week poking around finger really actually thinking cuff bottom section boot tried loosening top cuff varying degree even point feeling unstable yet even loose skating intense pressure bone read recently insole better arch support take pressure area read context pronation problem little confused wary anyone else problem think insole help eventually going take good amount time let ankle heal completely last time took full week though still healed heal slow usually even small scratch take longer week sometimes may inevitable dead winter coming anyway even heals problem getting back really want get entirely new skate either moment fix thought see anyone advice first,"['tl', 'dr', 'supination', 'problem', 'whenever', 'search', 'solution', 'find', 'solution', 'pronation', 'help', 'rare', 'problem', 'naturally', 'supinating', 'rather', 'pronating', 'since', 'got', 'skate', 'summer', 'swell', 'lite', 'always', 'dug', 'inner', 'ankle', 'bone', 'right', 'ankle', 'reason', 'left', 'ankle', 'fine', 'left', 'skate', 'fit', 'like', 'dream', 'general', 'feel', 'great', 'first', 'week', 'shifted', 'frame', 'far', 'outside', 'boot', 'could', 'immediately', 'helped', 'general', 'supination', 'problem', 'although', 'fix', 'completely', 'good', 'form', 'necessary', 'learn', 'time', 'first', 'thought', 'hard', 'plastic', 'part', 'come', 'around', 'heel', 'bottom', 'side', 'boot', 'digging', 'ankle', 'bone', 'reason', 'always', 'ha', 'r', 'bruising', 'mostly', 'bottom', 'bone', 'whole', 'bone', 'get', 'red', 'ever', 'blister', 'forming', 'even', 'hour', 'know', 'pressure', 'something', 'rubbing', 'upon', 'investigation', 'week', 'poking', 'around', 'finger', 'really', 'actually', 'thinking', 'cuff', 'bottom', 'section', 'boot', 'tried', 'loosening', 'top', 'cuff', 'varying', 'degree', 'even', 'point', 'feeling', 'unstable', 'yet', 'even', 'loose', 'skating', 'intense', 'pressure', 'bone', 'read', 'recently', 'insole', 'better', 'arch', 'support', 'take', 'pressure', 'area', 'read', 'context', 'pronation', 'problem', 'little', 'confused', 'wary', 'anyone', 'else', 'problem', 'think', 'insole', 'help', 'eventually', 'going', 'take', 'good', 'amount', 'time', 'let', 'ankle', 'heal', 'completely', 'last', 'time', 'took', 'full', 'week', 'though', 'still', 'healed', 'heal', 'slow', 'usually', 'even', 'small', 'scratch', 'take', 'longer', 'week', 'sometimes', 'may', 'inevitable', 'dead', 'winter', 'coming', 'anyway', 'even', 'heals', 'problem', 'getting', 'back', 'really', 'want', 'get', 'entirely', 'new', 'skate', 'either', 'moment', 'fix', 'thought', 'see', 'anyone', 'advice', 'first']",203

I rollerblade pretty much every day for about an hour in urban environments (sometimes pretty rough pavement as well).

2120,advice trinity frame versatile,rollerblading,"I recently bought Powerslide Tau with Nexus 3x90 rockerable frames. From old skates I also have elite casted 3x100 and ego 4x80.

I still cannot decide which frames I like most and constantly change them. But changing is not that easy and clean process and I’m also concerned if bolt mounts in the carbon will handle long term such frequent screwing and unscrewing.
So I was wondering from these three which can be considered most versatile and stay on the boots most of the time?
My ride is either urban city riding on bike lanes, sidewalks, neighborhood streets, etc, or when the weather is bad - underground parking lot and playing hockey, beginner slalom and basically improving specific tricks, slides...

I like the 4x80, because this is what I have used 20 years ago. They are low and easier to control. But slow for long rides.
I also like the 3x100 for long speedy runs, but I struggle a bit to be as precise, as with 4x80, because of the hight (I guess).
And now the new 4x90 that came with the Tau - should be exactly in between and theoretically replace both of the other two with minimal disadvantages.
But is it? Yes, they offer also rockering (should be very handy for hockey and slalom), but the huge gaps between the wheels seem strange and I wonder if that could be a problem on rough surfaces.",recently bought powerslide tau nexus x rockerable frame old skate also elite casted x ego x still cannot decide frame like constantly change changing easy clean process also concerned bolt mount carbon handle long term frequent screwing unscrewing wondering three considered versatile stay boot time ride either urban city riding bike lane sidewalk neighborhood street etc weather bad underground parking lot playing hockey beginner slalom basically improving specific trick slide like x used year ago low easier control slow long ride also like x long speedy run struggle bit precise x hight guess new x came tau exactly theoretically replace two minimal disadvantage yes offer also rockering handy hockey slalom huge gap wheel seem strange wonder could problem rough surface,"['recently', 'bought', 'powerslide', 'tau', 'nexus', 'x', 'rockerable', 'frame', 'old', 'skate', 'also', 'elite', 'casted', 'x', 'ego', 'x', 'still', 'cannot', 'decide', 'frame', 'like', 'constantly', 'change', 'changing', 'easy', 'clean', 'process', 'also', 'concerned', 'bolt', 'mount', 'carbon', 'handle', 'long', 'term', 'frequent', 'screwing', 'unscrewing', 'wondering', 'three', 'considered', 'versatile', 'stay', 'boot', 'time', 'ride', 'either', 'urban', 'city', 'riding', 'bike', 'lane', 'sidewalk', 'neighborhood', 'street', 'etc', 'weather', 'bad', 'underground', 'parking', 'lot', 'playing', 'hockey', 'beginner', 'slalom', 'basically', 'improving', 'specific', 'trick', 'slide', 'like', 'x', 'used', 'year', 'ago', 'low', 'easier', 'control', 'slow', 'long', 'ride', 'also', 'like', 'x', 'long', 'speedy', 'run', 'struggle', 'bit', 'precise', 'x', 'hight', 'guess', 'new', 'x', 'came', 'tau', 'exactly', 'theoretically', 'replace', 'two', 'minimal', 'disadvantage', 'yes', 'offer', 'also', 'rockering', 'handy', 'hockey', 'slalom', 'huge', 'gap', 'wheel', 'seem', 'strange', 'wonder', 'could', 'problem', 'rough', 'surface']",120

But every single time I go out, there's a whole lot of reactions from people around. Rollerblading just seems to make people super happy.

Kids usually point and ask what I'm doing. Parents are pretty happy to explain and like talking about with me. One kid ran up and smacked my knee pad with pure delight as I skated past (stupid but kids, ya know). 

Went up a small hill last week, and the guy behind yelled out ""COME ONNN YOU CAN DO IT"". It made me jump and I stacked it, but his heart was in the right place. We chatted afterwards.

Sometimes, I'll skate past people and hear them say ""I always wanted to try skating..""

Had a guy just today cycle past and offer me to hang on the back to get over a rough part of the pathway. I laughed, said no, he laughed. We're friends.

Razors Shima 3, boot only. Size 10. Asking $250. These are the rereleased version with the Razors liner. In fantastic shape. Skated a tiny bit but mostly just rolled around in. The shells do have some of that typical razors yellowing. The liners are in great shape, and in my opinion one of the better liners Razors made. These are quite rare. 

Razors Aragon 2, boot only, size 9. Asking $150. These were the very first SL's to be released, and came with a fantastic Jug Neoprene liner. Something that was different about these is the shock absorber was built into the footbed of the liner. The liner itself is in very very good shape. no tears or or issues. I have some extra parts I can throw in with these if the price is right. 

Deshi DK3 Louie Zamora, boot only, size 8. Asking $150. These were some of the best looking deshis that were made, in my opinion. Very light weight, and quite comfy. A true soft boot skate. These ones are in fantastic shape, hardly skated and not yet broken in. Come with CH1 souls which were one of their better soul offerings before they were phased out/absorbed by USD. 

Trust white Spec ops liner, size 9. Aksing $60. These were a great liner design that came out about 10 years ago or so. They were slim and comfortable, perfect for downsizing. They're made of a higher grade memory foam. These ones are in fantastic shape with no issues. 

Razors Elliot 3 liner, size 8. Asking $40. These came with the Jon Elliot 3 skates several years ago, and was one of the better liners Razors has come out with. It's slim and comfortable and seemed to be made of better materials than others at the time. These ones were my back up pair that I ended up hardly skating. 

Razors Cult Copper liner, size 9. Asking $30. Brand new liner, nothing too fancy here, just a brand new liner for a good price. 

Xsjado Damien Wilson 2, shell size small, Jeff Stockwell footwrap size 9. Asking $130. These are a pair of the Gen 1 Xsjados. The parts are all in really good shape. Has the double sided velcro cuff strap which were better imo. Footwraps are in great shape. Becoming harder to find good condition first gen Xsjados. 

Razors Murda 2, complete. Size 8. Asking $225. These come with like new souls, ground control dual injection frames, and Murda M1 wheels. The bearings are old and not the greatest. The jug liners are in fantastic shape. No internal tears or issues. One of the locks for the laces in cracked. 

Jug Vent Liners, size 9, asking $50. These are nearly new and in fantastic shape. Only skated a couple of times. Very hard to find jug liners any more, let alone in this condition. They're extremely light and quite comfy. One of the better liners to come from Jug. 

Razors Shima 6, Shell size 8-9, Reign liner size 10.5. I've been having a really hard time trying to decide if I want to sell these or not, and also trying to price them. These are some of the best Shima models to ever come out. The liners were amazing, reminiscent of the original Reign Neos (opposed to the S7 liners), the Hi Lo frame was innovative and still a fantastic design to this day, and the black and white colorway just works great paying homage to the Shima 1 and 2's. That said, although these are in very good shape, they're not pristine. One liners carrying strap has ripped as well as one of the top lacing eyelets. The inside of the liners are in great shape, no issues with the neoprene. There is some material missing on the inner parts where the velcro rubs, which is very common with the Reign Neo liners. Does not affect the actual performance. The wheels are not original, but are instead mindgame Aaron Feinbergs, and one of them has a wear groove in the side. The bearings are also old. The anti rockers are 2nd Regime. The soul frames have also been modified to sit the frame directly onto the boot, lowering the grinds...I think I would prefer to just take offers on these instead of putting a price on them, for now.

Razors Dre Powell, Size 9, complete. Asking $225. One of the coolest looking Genesys razors, in my opinion. Come with great Jug liners, and ground control 3rd gen frames. All parts are in fantastic shape. Jug liners are very comfy. 

I may have a few more things to add in later days.

2172,tried learn something skater stunt disney brink found extra info share,rollerblading,"&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this is a ""who cares?"" type of thing but I am sharing in case anyone else was also curious - 

I saw a video on Youtube where Tony Hawk talks about a bunch of Skateboarding movies and how real/legit the skateboarding in them is (vs which clips are obviously faked) and in it he was talking about which pro skateboarders did which stunts as stunt doubles for the characters. It made me curious about what skaters did the stunts for Brink! 

Were they pros? Did they skate before the movie? Or just talented stunt men and women that learned a bit of skating for the role? Do they still skate today? These are the types of questions I wanted to answer. 

I was very surprised that I could not find anybody discussing this type of thing online anywhere. 

All I had to go on was the IMDB page here. Scroll down to the ""stunts"" section -   
[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162212/fullcredits/?ref\_=tt\_ov\_st\_sm](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162212/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm)

I did not spend a ton of time snooping into this but I did search each name and see what I could find out. I was not sure which people on the list were actual skaters and which people just recorded stunts such as falls, or Gabriella's big jump over the truck could have been some type of rig, not real skating, or that sort of thing (I have no idea). I was trying to weed out the people that did real skating for the movie.   


Below are the people I believe are most likely to have done actual skating in the movie and what I could find out about each one.   
I am not certain about any of this. Its speculation. 

**Todd Matthew Grossman** \- Seems to be into Film, Directing, and still into action sports as well. He goes by TGFilms on Instagram and posted this pretty cool blading related picture on June 30th. Its a flashback to his past though, not recent -    


https://www.instagram.com/p/CCEW69\_JIky/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link    


**Laura Lee Connery** \- Her instagram is not very active, but on her website there is a pretty cool picture of her on blades doing some kind of flip (scroll to the bottom) - [http://www.lauraleeconnery.com/photos.htm](http://www.lauraleeconnery.com/photos.htm)   


**Cory M Miller** \- I could not find any recent references to him rollerblading anywhere (Instagram or Twitter) but I saw on IMDB that he is also in Batman and Robin (1997) and I think we are all aware of the rollerblading scene in that movie. So I assume that he did do some skating in Brink! This was all I had to go on though.   


**Sam Horrigan** \- Played Val. I think he did his own skating maybe? He is listed as the actor for Val as well as in the stunts section on IMDB. I could not really find anything about him skating now/recently or really any confirmation that he was a skater back then either, so I am not sure. I think his real instagram is set to private?

I wanted to know what are the benefits and downsides of this rockering set up, because once I'm comfortable and confident using the skates I plan on commuting on them. I've heard that the banana rockering adds better response to movement and turns, but makes the skate a bit wobbly. I've also heard that the set up is not very useful for speed, but that is not an issue for me as I am a beginner and I don't plan on going really fast just yet. My main concern is performance on pavement, for urban usage.

2197,hardboot upgrade,rollerblading,"Dear fellow skaters,

I'm currently skating Rollerblade Spark 90 (a simplified Macroblade 90). It's a fine fitness skate, I chose it over RB Cruiser, Tempest 100 and some other models about  a year and a half ago. My skates show a bit of wear now and don't hold my foot well, lacking heel lock down. Some tinkering with insoles (DIY antishocks) made heel more stable. They still fit me like a glove, but a loose one.

I'm looking forward to upgrade my skates to a ""serious"" one. I do a lot of city skating (commuting), no aggressive/fancy freeskate stuff, I prefer longer rides as fast as possible. I'd love to learn some slalom, just to feel more confident while riding.

Salespersons keep recommending me hard boot skates. I've already tried FR FRX 80, RB Twister, FE F4-F7, some Oxelos. Some fit better, some fit worse (i.e. Twister was too narrow), but those that fit feel too bulky, like my foot floating on liner clouds. Hardboots also restrict my ankle too much. They feel like overprotecting me.

I did try FE Drift and Drift 2. Very tight feeling, with painful pressure points. Lots of ankle restriction as well. I feel like I can appreciate Drifts, but they're like a foreign land to me.

I'm yet to try some marathon skates to get speedskate flavor with (not too much) ankle support (Like Tempest 100 I haven't ventured to buy yesteryear), but their longer frames may restrict maneuverability, that is vital to city skating.

Do I have to look more into hardboots/freeskates (there still are much more different hardboot skates available), or they're just not for anybody?

2203,servicing bladerunner bearing,rollerblading,"Hello! In my never-ending quest to get as many friends into skating as possible, I’ve been finding used skates for friends and offering to service them. It’s rotation time, and at least a few of the wheels could use a bearing cleaning.

However, the bearings won’t pop out! (I have the tool) this is particularly with a couple different models of Bladerunner skates. I press really hard and they just stay stuck.

Hi all, this is my first post in this sub so I apologize in advance if there are any formatting mistakes.

I recently started roller blading for the first time since I was a child, and I notice that the soles of my feet start to hurt after the first 5 min of skating. 

Its an intense pain like if I severely overworked my muscles, but it goes away when I stop skating or lift my foot from the ground 

It happens when I’m not curling my toes, and mostly when I am standing or gliding. I figured it’s just me not being used to skating, but for the past month, I have not noticed any improvements in this regard. 

Therefore I am beginning to suspect it might be another issue?

The skates themselves fell like they fit nicely, so I’m kind of lost in this regard.

2338,new skate review maxxum edge,rollerblading,"Finally arrived after waiting 4 months! Have a few comments for anyone considering them:

1) Sizing: I have read these skates are ""true to size"" and have also read these skates are 1/2 size too small.  My foot length is 27cm.  My old Zetrablades are size 10 and they are 1/2 size too big.  My new Maxxums are size 10 and fit perfectly.  I think that means you upsize 1/2 for these skates.

2) Wheels: Going from 80s to 90s: The wheels look bigger, but riding on them doesn't feel much different

3) Comfort: Out of the box, I skated 9 miles first day (the usual).  No pain, blisters, or bruises. Woo-hoo!

4) Ride: These skates are dramatically easier to use.  They are more maneuverable but doesn't feel like I've lost any control.  It takes less effort to  keep a pace.  On first day ride, my time fell on same route from 66 minutes two days prior on Zetrablades to 52 minutes on Maxxums.  On second day with these skates, I increased the ride from 9 miles to 12 miles but my average heart rate actually fell and I was less tired compared to a 9-mile ride with the old skates.

I’m seeking some advice. I use PS Zoom 80’s (not the pro version).

I’ve been skating a lot and the skates put loads of pressure on my right ankle. Primarily that inner, sticky out bony bit. It used to just cut it but my ankle has now swollen. 

I’m pretty sure it’s a sprain. But the skates always did this (put pressure there). My left foot is perfectly comfortable though and zero issues. 

I’m wondering what to do next. Do I need to expand the skate to create more space, or is the pressure actually important? Maybe I’ve been wearing the skates too tight or too loose? 

There weren’t any fitting instructions so I don’t know where I’m going wrong.

The padding is pretty minimal in these skates tbh. They’re an entry level skate. Maybe I need to skate with thick socks only?

Looking for any help not to permanently destroy my ankle (after it recovers).

2392,fr sizing question,rollerblading,"In Nov of last year I bought a pair of Twiser Edge Rollerblades.  After reading about having to size up I ordered  11.5 US.  I normally wear 10.5 shoes (few times 10, very few times 11).  I've now come to the conclusion that the 11.5 twisers are entirely too big, made worse by a very hard boot that simply cannot be tightened with laces.  

I've decided to replace them with FR1 90s, especially since the bigger wheels will feel much better in my city's terrible streets.  

My feet measure 26.7cm (right foot) and 27.0cm (left foot).  Looking at the [FR1 sizing chart](http://frskates.com/about-us/size-range) it would seem as if I should order size 9.  I am definitely hesitant to do so.  I'm in between ordering a size 10 *or* 10.5.  Anyone out there with similarly sized feet?  Other input regarding size &amp; fit (even if different than mine) are definitely welcome!

this is annoying, and as a musician it’s also SUPER distracting when i’m trying to pay attention on my skates.

i skate aggressive mainly, but this has been happening even just cruising around the neighborhood.

considering maybe trying some RayCons just because i keep seeing them everywhere and they’re affordable, but i’m wondering if anyone might have a suggestion for something with a more stable bluetooth connection than what i have now?",hey sorry wrong spot ask recently got set jlab goair wireless earbuds work fine walking around wearing task skate sound tends break lot start getting clippy annoying musician also super distracting trying pay attention skate skate aggressive mainly happening even cruising around neighborhood considering maybe trying raycons keep seeing everywhere affordable wondering anyone might suggestion something stable bluetooth connection,"['hey', 'sorry', 'wrong', 'spot', 'ask', 'recently', 'got', 'set', 'jlab', 'goair', 'wireless', 'earbuds', 'work', 'fine', 'walking', 'around', 'wearing', 'task', 'skate', 'sound', 'tends', 'break', 'lot', 'start', 'getting', 'clippy', 'annoying', 'musician', 'also', 'super', 'distracting', 'trying', 'pay', 'attention', 'skate', 'skate', 'aggressive', 'mainly', 'happening', 'even', 'cruising', 'around', 'neighborhood', 'considering', 'maybe', 'trying', 'raycons', 'keep', 'seeing', 'everywhere', 'affordable', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'might', 'suggestion', 'something', 'stable', 'bluetooth', 'connection']",59

2430,considering skate beginner advice,rollerblading,"Hi! Thanks guys for your advice earlier on what skates to consider. After reading those comments and doing some more research and sizing my feet, I'm considering these skates, any advice on what to get is good:

(For what I'm looking for: I'm looking to skate outside, with traffic/on some fairly rough roads and sidewalks, and parking lots, in Georgia so it's hot out if that matters. Size, I have 11cm wide feet, about 24cm long on one foot with socks on. I say this because according to their size charts 24cm is size 6, but I usually wear 8.5 women's so is that accurate..? Is it because skates should be tighter than tennis shoes..? Also unsure about the wide feet things).   


\-  K2 Skate F.I.T. 90 Boa Inline Skate (90mm seem good for a bigger size wheel without being too big to learn on I think? Also I'm in love with the colors on these. But I can't find many reviews on them. )  
\- FRX 80 Skates (People say these are good for wider feet..? And are just highly recommended by people on this Reddit it seems)  
\- Rollerblade Maxxum Edge 90 Inline Skate for Men (90mm, not so great colors imo but seems good)  
\- Rollerblade RB Cruiser Inline Skates (80mm, people say they're great for wider feet too and they're a really nice price, and I've seen them highly recommended also. Says to size up 1 so I'd get 7?)

2443,intuition liner gt myfit crown liner snug fitting larger shell,rollerblading,"TLDR: Intuition liners worked much better than stock or MyFit Crown liners to give me the snug fit I was looking for in FR1s. This surprised me as I thought the slender nature of these liners would be best for downsizing only -- not ""upsizing"". All I can say is try Intuition above all else, they've worked wonders for my fitment issues in Twister Edges and FR1s!

\--

I have a pair of FR1s that I have been trying to make fit as snug as possible, which has proven to be difficult. My feet are 24.5cm long and on the slim side of normal width. I've got a size 38 FR1 which means the shell is 26cm. I can't downsize to the next shell at 24cm so I'm stuck trying to fill in the gaps.

After reading about other people's set ups on here, I bought a pair of MyFit Crown Liners to provide more mass inside the shell as I thought that's what I needed for a snugger fit. While the liner itself is soft and very comfortable, most of the padding is in the cuff and heel area, which is not where I need padding at all. In fact the front half of the foot is where I could use more padding, and it is essentially just neoprene and quite narrow. Having SO MUCH padding around the cuff meant I couldn't properly tighten my ankle straps either, which lead to a lot of heel lift.

I had bought a pair of intuition liners for my Twister Edges and thought ""what the heck, let's see how they feel in my FR1s."" GAME CHANGER. Seriously, once I put them in, I was able to tighten all my straps to be super snug, just like I like, and despite being a narrower liner, I felt as though the shell was hugging my feet. I was worried there would be too much extra space in the shell between the liner and plastic but that doesn't seem to be the case. I don't fully understand the mechanics of it, but all I can say is it worked. Intuition liners really do make a world of difference and are so worth the extra $100 USD.

2449,fitting mm wheel kizer fluid iv frame,rollerblading,"Hi everyone!

I got my hands (or should i say, my feet) a pair of second hand Carbon Free Eugen Enin with Kizer Fluid IV clear frames.
They came with 4 Roman Abrate ""Circus"" 60 mm UC wheels, and some anti-rockers, but after a bit of playing around, the anti-rocker setup really isn't my thing and i got 4 more wheels to move to a flat setup.

Sadly, trying to mount the extra wheels i discovered that Fluid IV can only have 60 mm wheels on the outside, the two inner wheels seem to be limited to something like 57 mm, basically to anti-rockers.

I'm considering sanding down the part of the frame that prevents 60 mm wheels from fitting in slot 2 and 3, but given clear Fluid IV frames' [history of being fragile](https://www.reddit.com/r/rollerblading/comments/2lzcp3/buyer_beware_kizer_fluid_4_clear/), i'm wondering if it's even worth it, as they might break in the near future anyway.

Given i've now spent about £200 on the skates, then £65 on the wheels and bearings and another 27 on insoles, i was hoping not having to also get different frames…
(That being said, i'm remembering i have some old Ground Control frames, i think they are the first generation ones.. could always try that)

2468,improve fit skate liner tight,rollerblading,"Hi! So I have a pair of Seba FRX skates, in size EU42. I've owned them for a couple years now, and while I skate in them a decent bit, I still find them somewhat too tight, and I wanted some advice on how to improve that.

So, most notably, it's the liners themselves that are too tight. The hard shell alone is far more than big enough for my feet.

When wearing the liners on their own, however, I can tell that there is tightness in a couple of areas. Most particularly, my big toe feels slightly compressed (not quite scrunched, but enough to be uncomfortable), and the top of my foot feels pressure around where the tongue of the liner starts (enough that, sometimes, it noticeably reduces circulation to my feet). The rest of it feels comfortably snug.

Again, this tightness occurs even just wearing the liners over my socks, without the boots at all. So it's not being caused by over-lacing or over-tightening buckles or even the shape of the boot itself.

Interestingly, I believe that the EU41 and EU42 Sebas (and FRs) are the same hard shell size. I think it's weird that the hard shell on its own fits my foot fine, but the liners are too small.

So my question is, how can I improve this?

Obviously it seems like the ideal solution is to get a new liner. But which liners will be both 1) more spacious and 2) still small enough to fit in the EU41-42 FRX hard shell?

Could I get away with an FR EU43 liner? Or would that not fit in the hard shell I own? It's definitely a cheap option, if I can get away with it.

I know someone's going to tell me to get an Intuition liner. And okay, if it comes to that, I can do it. But I don't much care for their look, and they are tremendously expensive.

For sale are some lightly used Luigino Bont Speed Skates. Due to an ankle injury, I'm not able to use these as I would like. Cosmetically there are just a couple of scuffs on the inner and outer of the skate, very light blemishes. 

Mechanically they are perfect. Carbon layup on the bottom is beautiful with no chips or dings. 

Wheels measured with a caliper range from 97 mm to 99 mm. 100 mm stock. Lightly used and all regularly rotated so no sharp edges.

So here's the big question, which one do you think I could find more comfortable to learn in ?

I'm not entirely ""unhappy"" with my NEXT skates and I haven't entirely broken them in yet (or bothered to mold the liners), but getting them on seems to be a chore.

I'll explain. I haven't skated outdoors in years, most played indoor roller hockey for the last decade. I have hit the skate park with my kid a bit now and then and usually wear my old Roces which are great.

I wanted something ""urban"" and ""fast"". I went with a 4x80 setup for now. The last ""real"" outdoor skates I had were Rollerblade Lightnings (dating myself now) with custom liners. They were super comfortable and I could throw them on and off easily (never wore laces).

With the NEXT boot I can't even get them on properly without pulling the liner out of the shell and putting it on my foot first. When I do get them on they are stiff and start to hurt a bit until I stop and loosen the laces and adjust the buckles - then I'm good for a long while.

Just wondering if I should keep at it with these or try the FR1 or something else?

I’m new to the roller skate/blade community and I am curious about buying my first pair of skates. I am a high-level figure skater and have been doing it for many years. With the current climate I have thought about buying roller skates/blades so I can still keep up my work even if the rinks close down again. I am not really sure where to start whether to get inline or quads, what brands, price points, ect. When I was little, I had a pair of inlines and was pretty good on them but I not sure if I will be able to do “figure skating esc” moves on those. I need stiff ankle support and I don’t have a lot of space available. Any recommendations or advice would be a great help.",new roller skate blade community curious buying first pair skate high level figure skater many year current climate thought buying roller skate blade still keep work even rink close really sure start whether get inline quad brand price point ect little pair inlines pretty good sure able figure skating esc move need stiff ankle support lot space available recommendation advice would great help,"['new', 'roller', 'skate', 'blade', 'community', 'curious', 'buying', 'first', 'pair', 'skate', 'high', 'level', 'figure', 'skater', 'many', 'year', 'current', 'climate', 'thought', 'buying', 'roller', 'skate', 'blade', 'still', 'keep', 'work', 'even', 'rink', 'close', 'really', 'sure', 'start', 'whether', 'get', 'inline', 'quad', 'brand', 'price', 'point', 'ect', 'little', 'pair', 'inlines', 'pretty', 'good', 'sure', 'able', 'figure', 'skating', 'esc', 'move', 'need', 'stiff', 'ankle', 'support', 'lot', 'space', 'available', 'recommendation', 'advice', 'would', 'great', 'help']",63

2649,interesting powerslide carbon hardboot skate comparative,rollerblading,"Hi, [this](https://www.facebook.com/nob.miz/posts/3821525444525582) is the original publication on facebook by Nob Mizusawa, I post an automatic translation from japanese language:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It's not for anyone, but it's about time for a serious comparative review.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are different types of carbon boots, even if they are made of the same carbon, so first of all, the difference in that area.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;First, compare hard boots and soft boots in terms of boot structure.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course, the performance difference depending on the brand is also related, but in general, the hard boot type has less direct feeling and the feel of the frame is ambiguous.  
&gt;  
&gt;I think it's one of the criteria to choose as a preference, not whether this is good or bad.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, the hard boot type is more durable, and the inner can be replaced and the custom range is wider, so I think it's easier to match your taste.  
&gt;  
&gt;If there is a direct feeling, the mounting position of the frame will be severe, so it is good for people who drive in and search for the position, but if you just slide happily without thinking too much, you do not mind the ambiguous one.  
&gt;  
&gt;This area is remarkable when the mount is TRNITY, and the 165 mount with 2 points is more severe.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Next, a comparison between carbon boots and non-carbon (polyurethane or nylon with fiber).  
&gt;  
&gt;It is a comparison of the soft boot styles on the series that are out, but both have the same direct feeling.  
&gt;  
&gt;Carbon is overwhelmingly more rigid and less flexible.  
&gt;  
&gt;Conversely, vibrations and shocks come directly to your feet, so if the road surface continues to be bad, your feet will get tired.  
&gt;  
&gt;The merit is that it is lightweight and there is little loss in transmitting power ...  
&gt;  
&gt;Any pattern can be comfortably missed with a choice of frames and wheels, so carbon boots are recommended for those who have a budget that is not aggressive.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;And finally, carbon boots comparison.  
&gt;  
&gt;In fact, PS carbon boots have two types of bases.  
&gt;  
&gt;One is compression molded carbon used in tau and World Cup.  
&gt;  
&gt;The other is the carbon made in Japan used for EVO and RC1, which is the so-called wet carbon.  
&gt;  
&gt;Compression molded carbon is lightweight, hard and very thin so it has some flexibility and resilience.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since the thickness of the carbon part of tau is only about 1 to 2 mm, the rib shape on the sole keeps the rigidity.  
&gt;  
&gt;The reaction is quick, light, and moderate, so it is easy to handle.  
&gt;  
&gt;The carbon of EVO and RC1 is quite thick and has great rigidity.  
&gt;  
&gt;The weight is light as it is, but the hardness of the shell is more noticeable.  
&gt;  
&gt;Especially, the rigidity of the sole is high, especially the edge switching reaction on the toe side is terrifyingly fast and the power loss is extremely small.  
&gt;  
&gt;Double-push movements are much easier, so it's easier for people who aren't good at rowing on the out edge.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;By the way, RC1 has no cuff in the design, but you can think of it as the same boot because the carbon rising part of the base is up to the same position as EVO.  
&gt;  
&gt;I think it's a good idea to think of EVO as a thin interior and RC1 as a fluffy interior.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In particular, tau and EVO are similar in price, use, and position, so if you make a difference for those who are interested, is it the difference in the upper material and the thickness of the interior?  
&gt;  
&gt;The cuff, buckle and slider are exactly the same parts  
&gt;  
&gt;The manufacturer positions EVO as the top competition model and tau as the all-round flagship.  
&gt;  
&gt;The above review compared with the same frame, the same setup, and the same insoles.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, I forgot ... The old compression-molded carbon boots that cannot be thermoformed have a narrow foot type, and the current thermoformed-compatible model has the same middle foot type as EVO.  
&gt;  
&gt;Narrow is about the same size as the width one size higher than the middle, so be careful if you drive in and choose the size.  
&gt;  
&gt;The NEXT series is also middle, but slightly narrower than that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The same is true for hard boots, as the imperial series is narrow.",hi http www facebook com nob miz post original publication facebook nob mizusawa post automatic translation japanese language

Anyway I've been out and about a bit and played around on my skates a lot and it's safe to say that I really like rollerblading, but on my few adventures outside I've made a horrible realization: literally all of the pavement in my neighborhood and surrounding neighborhoods is trash. Like half the roads through my neighborhood are unpaved and the ones that are paved are badly maintained. That said I'm no quitter and I'm looking to further my skating career. 

So now that I've decided that I like skating, I'm looking to upgrade to a new set of skates. I need them to have big wheels, even for fitness/free skates, so bigger than 80/84 for sure. I've been looking at Powerslide because obviously they're well known for big wheels and triskates, but I'm not particularly set on the brand. Specifically, I spotted the Powerslide Next with the [4x90 Kizer frames](https://www.proskatersplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PS-Next-Burgundy-Grey-80.jpg) that can double as 3x100 frames and I was super interested in those, but I wasn't sure if the 90mm wheels will be a big enough difference from the 4x80's for me.

**TL;DR:** So my main question is basically: If my roads are like mega mega bad should I go for big big wheels on triskates (like 3x110 or 3x125) or should I go with the 4x90 wheels or some alternate option?

And also if I should go with triskates should I go with 125's or 110's? I hear a lot of people saying that they don't find 125's controllable enough, but if it's a big enough benefit on bad roads maybe the larger size is worth learning to control?

**Side notes**:

\-I'm in the PNW so rain/wet pavement will always be an issue if that makes a difference between setups (I found that rockered wheels were just terrifying for me with even slightly wet pavement)

\-I have wide feet so the Powerslide Next toe box was appealing to me because I hear people saying it has a nice wide fit to it. Also bony ankles apparently but tbh I'm willing to just buy a heat gun and fix any problems that might arise if the skate is good

\-My budget is $250-300 max. I'm fairly poor so I'm investing in something that will help me work through depression and stuff, so it's worth it to get a good product, but I've got limited funds",fairly new skater classic thing bought pair cheap skate sure getting blading anyway bit played around skate lot safe say really like rollerblading adventure outside made horrible realization literally pavement neighborhood surrounding neighborhood trash like half road neighborhood unpaved one paved badly maintained said quitter looking skating career decided like skating looking upgrade new set skate need big wheel even fitness free skate bigger sure looking powerslide obviously well known big wheel triskates particularly set brand specifically spotted powerslide next x kizer frame http www proskatersplace com wp content uploads p next burgundy grey jpg double x frame super interested sure mm wheel big enough difference x tl dr main question basically road like mega mega bad go big big wheel triskates like x x go x wheel alternate option also go triskates go hear lot people saying find controllable enough big enough benefit bad road maybe larger size worth learning control side note pnw rain wet pavement always issue make difference setup found rockered wheel terrifying even slightly wet pavement wide foot powerslide next toe box appealing hear people saying nice wide fit also bony ankle apparently tbh willing buy heat gun fix problem might arise skate good budget max fairly poor investing something help work depression stuff worth get good product got limited fund,"['fairly', 'new', 'skater', 'classic', 'thing', 'bought', 'pair', 'cheap', 'skate', 'sure', 'getting', 'blading', 'anyway', 'bit', 'played', 'around', 'skate', 'lot', 'safe', 'say', 'really', 'like', 'rollerblading', 'adventure', 'outside', 'made', 'horrible', 'realization', 'literally', 'pavement', 'neighborhood', 'surrounding', 'neighborhood', 'trash', 'like', 'half', 'road', 'neighborhood', 'unpaved', 'one', 'paved', 'badly', 'maintained', 'said', 'quitter', 'looking', 'skating', 'career', 'decided', 'like', 'skating', 'looking', 'upgrade', 'new', 'set', 'skate', 'need', 'big', 'wheel', 'even', 'fitness', 'free', 'skate', 'bigger', 'sure', 'looking', 'powerslide', 'obviously', 'well', 'known', 'big', 'wheel', 'triskates', 'particularly', 'set', 'brand', 'specifically', 'spotted', 'powerslide', 'next', 'x', 'kizer', 'frame', 'http', 'www', 'proskatersplace', 'com', 'wp', 'content', 'uploads', 'p', 'next', 'burgundy', 'grey', 'jpg', 'double', 'x', 'frame', 'super', 'interested', 'sure', 'mm', 'wheel', 'big', 'enough', 'difference', 'x', 'tl', 'dr', 'main', 'question', 'basically', 'road', 'like', 'mega', 'mega', 'bad', 'go', 'big', 'big', 'wheel', 'triskates', 'like', 'x', 'x', 'go', 'x', 'wheel', 'alternate', 'option', 'also', 'go', 'triskates', 'go', 'hear', 'lot', 'people', 'saying', 'find', 'controllable', 'enough', 'big', 'enough', 'benefit', 'bad', 'road', 'maybe', 'larger', 'size', 'worth', 'learning', 'control', 'side', 'note', 'pnw', 'rain', 'wet', 'pavement', 'always', 'issue', 'make', 'difference', 'setup', 'found', 'rockered', 'wheel', 'terrifying', 'even', 'slightly', 'wet', 'pavement', 'wide', 'foot', 'powerslide', 'next', 'toe', 'box', 'appealing', 'hear', 'people', 'saying', 'nice', 'wide', 'fit', 'also', 'bony', 'ankle', 'apparently', 'tbh', 'willing', 'buy', 'heat', 'gun', 'fix', 'problem', 'might', 'arise', 'skate', 'good', 'budget', 'max', 'fairly', 'poor', 'investing', 'something', 'help', 'work', 'depression', 'stuff', 'worth', 'get', 'good', 'product', 'got', 'limited', 'fund']",216

2683,fell water,rollerblading,"So today was a really nice day and decided to try my new blades. Everything was going pretty smooth, they felt really comfortable on my feet; however they are a little bit heavy for what I was used to. Anyways, the park in which I skate the roads are surrounding a lake and some sections have a little bit of inclination towards the lake. Since I'm quite new, like 30+ hours skating I lost control in one of this sections and was heading towards the lake (not falling but like type of running losing control on the grass) and my skates got wet almost everywhere, but the wheels and most part of the frame where definitely underwater, it really sucks, thankfully I was heading back to my car. I'm worried cause everyone says to avoid water at all cost and I don't know what to do now. This is how the lake looks like.

We live in the Netherlands and everything around us but the bike paths are cobblestone, which, whether she admits it or not, is what's ultimately thwarted every other wheeled experience she's had around here. I've been eyeing up what the skaters around here wear, and they tend to have the larger wheels. 

I've been trying to source some skates that we can manage for holiday presents, but it seems like most of the inline skates I find with the 90-110mm wheels also seem to lack brakes. There's a few exceptions that are Rollerblade branded, but those also come in over €150, which isn't really in our budget this year. Here's the skates we're looking at, priced at €60 with not-terrible reviews:

2720,first freeskates intermediate level,rollerblading,"Hi! I always have loved rollerblading in general, when I was a child I played in a hockey team and I really liked it. I'd like to start in freeskate, I think I skate quite well, although I have never had tricks and jumps like in freeskate, so I believe my rolling level could be intermediate.

I'd like skates that can be used for **everything**: more or less long routes, some tricks, and specially urban routes. What should I choose?

* 3x110 (better for routes and ground irregularities)
* 4x80 (better for tricks, more agile)
* 3x100 (a intermediate size)

So, I need help to choose my first freeskates. I've been looking for different options like:

* Powerslide zoom pro 100 black: 189€
* Powerslide imperial 110: 200€
* Fila houdini pro 110: 200€
* An exception was: FR FR3 310: 229€

My choice at the moment is the intermediate size with 100mm (PS zoom pro) but I don't know if they are too basic. I would'n like to spend more than 200€ but if it's really worth it I'd try to spend a little more.(if there is other interesting offer or model in this price range, pls comment).",hi always loved rollerblading general child played hockey team really liked like start freeskate think skate quite well although never trick jump like freeskate believe rolling level could intermediate like skate used everything le long route trick specially urban route choose x better route ground irregularity x better trick agile x intermediate size need help choose first freeskates looking different option like powerslide zoom pro black powerslide imperial filum houdini pro exception fr fr choice moment intermediate size mm p zoom pro know basic would n like spend really worth try spend little interesting offer model price range pls comment,"['hi', 'always', 'loved', 'rollerblading', 'general', 'child', 'played', 'hockey', 'team', 'really', 'liked', 'like', 'start', 'freeskate', 'think', 'skate', 'quite', 'well', 'although', 'never', 'trick', 'jump', 'like', 'freeskate', 'believe', 'rolling', 'level', 'could', 'intermediate', 'like', 'skate', 'used', 'everything', 'le', 'long', 'route', 'trick', 'specially', 'urban', 'route', 'choose', 'x', 'better', 'route', 'ground', 'irregularity', 'x', 'better', 'trick', 'agile', 'x', 'intermediate', 'size', 'need', 'help', 'choose', 'first', 'freeskates', 'looking', 'different', 'option', 'like', 'powerslide', 'zoom', 'pro', 'black', 'powerslide', 'imperial', 'filum', 'houdini', 'pro', 'exception', 'fr', 'fr', 'choice', 'moment', 'intermediate', 'size', 'mm', 'p', 'zoom', 'pro', 'know', 'basic', 'would', 'n', 'like', 'spend', 'really', 'worth', 'try', 'spend', 'little', 'interesting', 'offer', 'model', 'price', 'range', 'pls', 'comment']",100

2. I took a bad fall day one on the skates and scuffed them up a bit so returning them is not an option.

Other than the fit, does the plastic boot you use really matter if you're swapping the frames and liners?  Especially, like many others, are swapping the frames to endless and the liners to intuition.

I saw someone post the forrest green Flying Eagles, which inspired this thought as I LOVE the look of those boots.  I also really like the look of the rollerblade twister's edge but hate this year's current color way (other than the X version), and finally like the look and color way of the powerslide imperial but they're not considered ""higher performance"" boots.

2786,break period new skate,rollerblading,"TL;DR At the bottom 

Hey guys! Used to skate back in the day and recently got back into it. Posted here and everyone recommended to aeon 80s, which I truly think are the perfect skates for me. 

I’m a size 8-9 in regular shoes, 40-41 in climbing shoes/EU size, and my foot is 9.8”/25cm long. 

I chose the smallest aeon 80 size, which according to their measurements seemed plenty big. Even contacted support and they confirmed the size based on my foot length and size. 

The skates came and I’ve used them twice, both times my right foot went numb halfway through a 1hr skate. My right foot feels very very tight, especially the pressure pushing down on the top of my foot. I tried not tightening my right foot as much, but still had the numbness problem. I’m used to climbing shoes so I totally understand shoes being tight on a good way. These don’t feel like that. 

I’m currently wearing the liners around the house to try and break them in more. By themselves, outside of the boot, they aren’t terribly tight. They feel snug, but again, not making me numb. 

I guess my main question is what the break in period for liners is, and any tips to break them in faster? These are heat moldable, would that give my feet more space? I’m within the return window so I don’t want to heat mold them unless I plan to keep them. I worry that if I go up an entire size it will be too big, but the next size up is closer to what I wear in climbing shoes and what seems right. I just don’t want to have to return these pay restocking fee pay shipping etc. They are already expensive, and of course I did my best to figure my sizing out before buying (don’t have any local shops sadly). I would truly appreciate any advice you guys and gals have! 

TL;DR - What is the break in period for skate liners? Should my feet be falling asleep/what sort of pain is acceptable during break in period? I really don’t want to have to return these!

I bought my first skates (Maxxum Edge 90) in July, mainly because I discovered the ""Skate to ski"" program. After some practice, I really enjoyed rollerblading, apart from ski-oriented training. I later bought the rb cruisers too, mostly to use them in the gym and try the difference with the 4x80. I didn't like the rb cruiser liner at all, but I found the 4x80 much more manageable and fun to use.

Since wandering around the city is the thing I like the most, I thought about buying the 3x110 frame for the maxxum or even a new pair of skates (it seems that in the end you get to spend more or less the same amount, and I would still keep the maxxum for ski training).

A friend of mine, however, told me that from 4x90 to 3x110 would not change much .. what do you think? I expect from the 3x110 more speed, less stability but more handling than the 4x90 .. am I wrong? And which skates would you recommend me?

2897,weak ankle overweight worried hurting,rollerblading,"Hey fellas,

So for the past half a decade I've lived a pretty sedentary life, mostly sitting, virtually no excersize. I was tall and lean up until about a year ago, when I was diagnosed with cancer and put on a crazy amount of weight during chemo.

I need to get out more. I need to start moving again, my body craves it, but I HATE walking/running, and I haven't been able to find a bike that was comfortable to me. As a kid, I loved rollerblading all over the place, so I figured I'd start again. I bought a cheap pair and some protective equipment and plan to start in a nearby park with some flat paved paths. The problem is, when I tried them on in my apt my ankles caved inwards, and I really struggled to stand up straight at all. I had them tightened snugly and they seemed to fit well, I think it was just my ankles being weak due to my lifestyle and the weight my new body was putting on them. Maybe it was the fact that I was trying to stand up straight without falling and wasn't in a proper ""standing still"" position? 

My question is, would you guys recommend trying to strengthen my ankles before I try again? Or should I just get started, fall a lot and hope my ankles shape up naturally? I'd rather play it safe. 

I should also clarify that I have a genetic ligament elasticity issue, and despite that my ankles hold me just fine when standing on my actual feet.",hey fella past half decade lived pretty sedentary life mostly sitting virtually excersize tall lean year ago diagnosed cancer put crazy amount weight chemo need get need start moving body craves hate walking running able find bike comfortable kid loved rollerblading place figured start bought cheap pair protective equipment plan start nearby park flat paved path problem tried apt ankle caved inwards really struggled stand straight tightened snugly seemed fit well think ankle weak due lifestyle weight new body putting maybe fact trying stand straight without falling proper standing still position question would guy recommend trying strengthen ankle try get started fall lot hope ankle shape naturally rather play safe also clarify genetic ligament elasticity issue despite ankle hold fine standing actual foot,"['hey', 'fella', 'past', 'half', 'decade', 'lived', 'pretty', 'sedentary', 'life', 'mostly', 'sitting', 'virtually', 'excersize', 'tall', 'lean', 'year', 'ago', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'put', 'crazy', 'amount', 'weight', 'chemo', 'need', 'get', 'need', 'start', 'moving', 'body', 'craves', 'hate', 'walking', 'running', 'able', 'find', 'bike', 'comfortable', 'kid', 'loved', 'rollerblading', 'place', 'figured', 'start', 'bought', 'cheap', 'pair', 'protective', 'equipment', 'plan', 'start', 'nearby', 'park', 'flat', 'paved', 'path', 'problem', 'tried', 'apt', 'ankle', 'caved', 'inwards', 'really', 'struggled', 'stand', 'straight', 'tightened', 'snugly', 'seemed', 'fit', 'well', 'think', 'ankle', 'weak', 'due', 'lifestyle', 'weight', 'new', 'body', 'putting', 'maybe', 'fact', 'trying', 'stand', 'straight', 'without', 'falling', 'proper', 'standing', 'still', 'position', 'question', 'would', 'guy', 'recommend', 'trying', 'strengthen', 'ankle', 'try', 'get', 'started', 'fall', 'lot', 'hope', 'ankle', 'shape', 'naturally', 'rather', 'play', 'safe', 'also', 'clarify', 'genetic', 'ligament', 'elasticity', 'issue', 'despite', 'ankle', 'hold', 'fine', 'standing', 'actual', 'foot']",123

My first question was, do I want 4x80 or 3x110? I eventually decided I want both so I'll get a hybrid frame later on down the road that can do both 4x80 and 3x110, or get a second frame for my boot. Because of this, I am now looking for one of these set ups. 

* Boot with hybrid frame that I can swap the wheels out in

* Boot with two frames, one 4 and one 3 wheel frame that I swap out (I don't care about the speed of swapping out, no need for the quick swap feature I saw) 

* Two separate pairs of skates

I was also looking at the Powerslide Next Core 80, but read that Powerslide's run narrow. Any recommendations for wide boots? 258mm long, 105mm wide. High arch. Looking to ride to work and around town on the 4x80's and have a 3x100 or 3x110 set up for longer rides down the storm channel to the beach. Budget is around $300 or less. Currently leaning towards the FRX 80 skates because I hear they run wide. Also they seem to be called FR skates or Seba skates? What's up with that? The FRX 80's are approx $200 currently, if the extra $100 can get me started towards the 2nd frame set, that would be great. Or would you say spending $300 on the pair of 4x80 skates is worth the upgrade from the FRX 80's?

I find quads super easy to turn, transition, jam etc. due to them moving from the ankle and trucks, but when I put my inlines on they're incredibly hard to turn, let alone transition or anything else. Admittedly, my inlines were literally £50, have garbage ABEC 3 bearings in them, as well as being made from cheap plastic, and the liner is trash, unsupportive and slides when I try to skate 😂 

My question is, am I finding it hard to manoeuvre because I need to commit more  from my knee, or are my cheap-ass skates working against me a bit too?

Also the frame is made of the same plastic as the shell and I'm pretty sure I can feel it bend slightly when I try to use my outside edges 😂 

I'm thinking of upgrading soon anyway but I'm conflicted as to whether I should keep trying to learn on my cheap skates until I get the hang of it, and then upgrade, or if I should just bite the bullet and buy some Proskate Zoom pro 80s or FR X 80s or something?

3028,need guidance either buying new skate modding current one,rollerblading,"Hello! I wanted to start out by saying i own a pair of Razor Cult B's that i purchased over 10 years ago when i was a younger and skinnier person. I just never skated very much in them.

When i was a kid/teen in the mid-late 90's i would play roller hockey and skate on some basic blades and to my recollection i would kick ass on these skates and really carve pretty well. Unfortunatley these Razors do not offer the same skate feeling and holy shit these boots are heavy! (why i dont really use them much) I don't really recall why i bought them in the first place but i might have had aspirations of doing a few tricks here and there, but i miss 4 wheels, and being able to crossover turns (the wheels are too small)

So getting to the point. I have looked at some frames i could change out to use larger wheels, but they cost about as much as an intro level skate. Then id still have the issue of the heavy boot, which to be honest hurt my out of shape and weak ankle/mid leg area. So should i buy new skates? and if i do what would be a decent boot to look at in regards to air flow and being light weight. Also, while shopping around i came across rockered skates. Would that be a good place to start if im just getting back into this? 

I had my eye on the 5th element st-80s but im concerned about the rocker set up on those, and the boots dont look much different than my current ones. I also had been looking at roller hockey skates (ultimate goal to play causal roller hockey and skate for exercise), but found out those have a different rocker set up but might only work for smoother areas.

The place where i live and areas i currently skate are not the smoothest. I am a big heavy dude (6' ~285) and id like to skate every day and get in shape but my current set up and skate locations are killing my legs (expected) and the close calls for busing my ass on these cracks, gaps, and uneven ground are too high. 

Tl;dr: fat guy wants to skate and feel free while skating on uneven haggard ass concrete. Needs either bigger wheels than currently owns, and possibly a lighter boot. 

-Also if anyone in the San Diego area can point me to any good spots  to skate or shops to buy from i'd appreciate it.

3029,overcoming fear trick,rollerblading,"So, a few days ago I picked up a used pair of skates. Today I got my new frames, Kaltik v2 flat setup. Suits me much better than anti-rocker since I feel more control about my skates.

Today at the local skatepart I tried to do my very first trick, the soulgrind. Since blading isn't very common in Copenhagen, i'm left with youtube tutorials. I started out slowly with just placing my right foots soulplate on the rail to get the feeling - I then tried to balance on the boot. Slowly but steady (45 min) I did my first jump on the rail with both feet in 'propper' position. It was a huge achievement for me, and I then gradially started to gain a little speed. My longest grind was about 5-7 inches. Isn't much, but something. I now understand why Anti-rocker is easier for grinds! :)

I don't know the name of the ramps, but the ""box"" I practiced my soulgrind on was about 13.5 inch / 35 cm in height, which I personally felt intimidated by. It was the smallest ramp I had at the park - Would it make sense to start at lower heights? Or is that height ""standard"". And is soulgrind even one of the first tricks to learn? I feel it's rather complicated - Maybe I just need to get a hang off it!

I'm not young anymore, so the fear of causing major damage to my body or head surely puts me back. I got a helmet on, and will get hand and knee-guards very soon. The fear right before the jump really puts me back - and i'm sure it's one of the reasons the trick is so ''tricky'' for me.

Have you guys any good experience with learning new tricks (for beginners on aggressive skates) and how did you overcome the fear of falling?

3033,different heat molding technique,rollerblading,"I'm curious about different peoples' experience and methods of heat molding.

I've heard of:

 Baking them at 80C (170~F) for 10-15 minutes

Heat gun

Hair dryer


For the actual molding, I've heard of:

Pushing on spots gently with the butt of a screwdriver handle or the like.

Putting the entire skate on (after baking specifically) and lacing/strapping it up EXTRA tight, then putting your legs in generally the position they'll be in when you're in the ""predator stance"", and wait for them to cool down completely.


Has anyone used any other methods? I'm curious because I don't have an oven, and I also don't have a heat gun. I suppose I could just go buy a heat gun, but I'm always curious just for the sake of curiosity once a question like this comes up.

Anyone tried using a space heater? Just putting the boot really near it for a while?

3056,hard soft boot,rollerblading,"Hi! I know this question is asked a lot but I'm still really unsure of what I should get! I have a second hand pair of soft boot inline skates and I really like them apart from the pain I get in my right foot. The boot seems to squeeze my foot causing pain in the arch after about 10 mins of skating. I'm not sure if its my technique, the skate, or if that's normal? My feet pronate naturally without skates so I am wondering if a hard boot would be best? I'm only a causal skater but ultimately want to end up skating along the seafront so need something thats comfortable for more than 10 mins. 

I'm currently looking at the Powerslide Phuzion Radon Teal 80 Inline Skates or the Impalas (I know these have a mixed reputation though). 

The advice seems to be contradictory for my needs so if anyone has any thoughts I'd be really glad to hear them!

I have my size down as well: 27.3 cm

With my reading, I think acquired ***some*** understanding of the different types of skates - large v/s small wheels and/or base, number of wheels, freestyle/speed, and aggressive and all that these can or can not be used for. But because my knowledge is not yet there, I'd like to get some inputs from folks on the type of skates to get (Sidenote: I agree with the mod/meta post - this sub can use a buyer guide of sorts) 

I think you all will be able to better help me if I tell you about my purpose. So as a first-time skater (inline or otherwise) my first goal is to get comfortable and in control of something rolling under my feet. However, the idea of going to a park and trying a few tricks in the future also excites me (and lowkey scares too but that is for later).

So keeping that in mind - the learning curve for basics (maneuver, balance, and stopping) and future wish-list (going aggressive) I guess the USD AEON 80 would be a good (albeit pricey) option. I think it gives me a large enough wheel size for the first part and the build/structure for the second one. What do you guys think? Or should I go for a medium price freestyle/recreational ones right now and get a separate pair for aggressive when the time comes? 

Also, I wasn't able to find something that I could compare to the USD AEONs outright (mostly because of lack of knowledge) so if there's something out (other brands or models) there please let me know.",receiving encouraging comment http www reddit com r rollerblading comment jksa w failed roller skating young would utm source share amp utm medium web x amp context member thinking bit next step started reading past post listening yt video reading literature online research skate option size well cm reading think acquired understanding different type skate large v small wheel base number wheel freestyle speed aggressive used knowledge yet like get input folk type skate get sidenote agree mod meta post sub use buyer guide sort think able better help tell purpose first time skater inline otherwise first goal get comfortable control something rolling foot however idea going park trying trick future also excites lowkey scare later keeping mind learning curve basic maneuver balance stopping future wish list going aggressive guess usd aeon would good albeit pricey option think give large enough wheel size first part build structure second one guy think go medium price freestyle recreational one right get separate pair aggressive time come also able find something could compare usd aeon outright mostly lack knowledge something brand model please let know,"['receiving', 'encouraging', 'comment', 'http', 'www', 'reddit', 'com', 'r', 'rollerblading', 'comment', 'jksa', 'w', 'failed', 'roller', 'skating', 'young', 'would', 'utm', 'source', 'share', 'amp', 'utm', 'medium', 'web', 'x', 'amp', 'context', 'member', 'thinking', 'bit', 'next', 'step', 'started', 'reading', 'past', 'post', 'listening', 'yt', 'video', 'reading', 'literature', 'online', 'research', 'skate', 'option', 'size', 'well', 'cm', 'reading', 'think', 'acquired', 'understanding', 'different', 'type', 'skate', 'large', 'v', 'small', 'wheel', 'base', 'number', 'wheel', 'freestyle', 'speed', 'aggressive', 'used', 'knowledge', 'yet', 'like', 'get', 'input', 'folk', 'type', 'skate', 'get', 'sidenote', 'agree', 'mod', 'meta', 'post', 'sub', 'use', 'buyer', 'guide', 'sort', 'think', 'able', 'better', 'help', 'tell', 'purpose', 'first', 'time', 'skater', 'inline', 'otherwise', 'first', 'goal', 'get', 'comfortable', 'control', 'something', 'rolling', 'foot', 'however', 'idea', 'going', 'park', 'trying', 'trick', 'future', 'also', 'excites', 'lowkey', 'scare', 'later', 'keeping', 'mind', 'learning', 'curve', 'basic', 'maneuver', 'balance', 'stopping', 'future', 'wish', 'list', 'going', 'aggressive', 'guess', 'usd', 'aeon', 'would', 'good', 'albeit', 'pricey', 'option', 'think', 'give', 'large', 'enough', 'wheel', 'size', 'first', 'part', 'build', 'structure', 'second', 'one', 'guy', 'think', 'go', 'medium', 'price', 'freestyle', 'recreational', 'one', 'right', 'get', 'separate', 'pair', 'aggressive', 'time', 'come', 'also', 'able', 'find', 'something', 'could', 'compare', 'usd', 'aeon', 'outright', 'mostly', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'something', 'brand', 'model', 'please', 'let', 'know']",182

Today we got some pretty big attention from Cheddar Gadgets.  Again, not going to shill here but you can look it up if you want.  (this is as close as self-promoting as we're going to get.  Promise).  The thing is that this is all taking place on Facebook. 

So we get it.  Our product is polarizing.  It's not for everyone.  In fact, there are two camps.  The first camp is the people who have seen it and ridden it.  Those people are super positive and give us hope there's a future here.  The second group are, of course, on Facebook. 

The special subset of that group is the gatekeeping, self-important, exclusionary type of skater who feels that they are the sole arbiter of who is *allowed* to skate.  The ones who talk about physically attacking people who they disagree with.  And this is why you, /r/rollerblading, are awesome.  Every day there are posts from beginners, advanced skaters, casual or frequent skaters, and the community here is typically really great about not being that kind of gatekeeping, exclusionary skater.

3093,noob question pressure point buckle zetrablade,rollerblading,"Hi folks!

&amp;#x200B;

Last time I had rollerblades was when I was 12 or so, I'm turning 30 this week and my wife got me a pair of zetrablades.

It's a lot of fun!

&amp;#x200B;

One problem I have is that the buckle (or the plastic part the buckle is mounted on) is putting pressure on the inside of my leg above the ankle. This happens on both sides. I've tried loosening the buckle, and it helps the pressure a little bit, but then there's too much side to side play in the sake.  


Is this normal or something to get used to?

I saw some posts about using a heat gun to reshape the plastic, I have a heat gun but am not sure how I'd reshape this bit (beyond twisting it), as I think it would put pressure as soon as I tighten the clasp again.

My primary goal is to get in shape/improve my health and have a little fun doing it, maybe find a new hobby. I used to run but I had a bad knee injury a few years ago so I thought this would be easier on my joints.

I looked at your buying guide and I’ve been doing a lot of research, but there are just so many options I am feeling overwhelmed. I’m worried about buying the wrong ones, and im tight on money so I kinda have one chance at buying these.

I think these ones might be good for me: https://www.inlinewarehouse.com/K2_Alexis_84_Pro/descpage-201401.html

Any feedback or tips? I really am trying to keep my budget to $150 so these ones are kinda pushing it, but I don’t want to be uncomfortable.

I haven’t skated in like 20 years so I’m a complete newb. There are miles of pretty paved trails by my house I plan to go on. So Any feedback, tips, suggestions - I’m all ears.

I'm looking to get new skates, since I'm majorly sold into believing that I can actually skate well and now equipment needs to be upgraded before I build my skill. 

I plan to skate the sidewalks, roads and pavements and across other urban infra, however, I don't plan to go aggressive or try getting air, except the minor air needed to navigate around..

Questions.
1. Trinity seems to offer great stability due to the triangle connection and lower ground clearance if I must put it that way. Is it big enough to not even think about non Powerslide Trinity setups?

2. 80mm seems to be the most used 4 wheels setup, and I'm kind of confused whether to go for 90mm 4 wheels or 100x3.

I find these straps a bit too thin. I would expect them to be a bit wider and more robust. But maybe I'm  wrong about why they chose to design them this way. The double ratchet system is genius though - two offset levers allow you to release one tooth at a time.

I've known some people lately to skate with and we do some routes around the city. When skating downhill most of them seem very confident and don't brake until the end, but I don't trust myself that much and control the speed with a T from time to time.

I think this can be even worse because when doing the T at high speed I could even unstabilize myself, and also it wears the wheels a lot...

Should I just grow a pair and crouch and go down the hill? How do you advice controlling speed? what makes me brake from time to time is the possible situation of having to stop suddenly, and I can't do a powerslide/powerstop going too fast...

 I bought them in november 2018.

We both reached out to USPS, who claimed they didn’t even have the package in their system. It was super sketch. So they file a claim and once the claim is approved, they issue my a full refund and apologize for all the complications. The whole time, their communication was just lovely. 

Fast forward about a week after that, I receive the wheels in the mail. I was genuinely shocked they showed up, because once mail is lost, seems like it never shows up again, right? Anyway, after weeks of not being able to skate, I was hella stoked. But I knew I couldn’t just keep them. I emailed Oak City letting them know I got the wheels and that I’d ship them back to them ASAP at their request. And their response? They were just line “you’ve been waiting for them so long, go ahead and keep them”. 

You know that warm feeling you get in your chest when a stranger is nice to you? Like how when a random car lets you merge when no other car will? Or when someone gives you a compliment while you’re having an awful day?

3244,kizer fluid frame rolling resistance brief thought current flat frame,rollerblading,"I really enjoy the Kizer Fluid 5 frame. It's got a really nice thick frame wall, a nice shallow groove (the overly deep groove was the issue I had with Fluid 3 and Fluid 4 frames) and the material is as good as ever. The frame is stiff and offers great power transfer.

The problem I'm having with Fluid 5s is that the wheels just don't roll like they should. I've been struggling to figure out what it is. I'm rocking GO Project 56mm wheels with some ABEC 5 bearings, and compared to the other setups I've been using it just feels a bit like rolling through glue. They don't roll as they should.

Has anyone else experienced this?

Currently I'm thinking that the problem is the fitment of the wheels in the frames. The frames have metal spacers, which are great, but I've never had such a problem installing wheels before. I had to resort to hammering them in (literally, with a hammer). Probably hasn't done wonders for my bearings...

Would like to hear if anyone else has had this issue, or an issue with installing wheels, and of any tips for wheel installation to make it easier and perhaps not damage bearings in the process...

Some background and general flat-frame thoughts, if that's what you came here for:

I've been skating flat for about 10 years. Before that I was mostly riding freestyle with some anti-rocker. The first frame to work for me was the first line of Create Original frames, and since then I've really enjoyed skating Fiziks and more recently Oysi flat. I tried the Sola frames but couldn't get on with the slim frame walls and lack of wheel cupping - it just made it that much more difficult to grind and wasn't my thing. Sola frames are an excellent product, however, the build quality and design that went into them is second-to-none and I can see why they work for so many people.",really enjoy kizer fluid frame got really nice thick frame wall nice shallow groove overly deep groove issue fluid fluid frame material good ever frame stiff offer great power transfer problem fluid wheel roll like struggling figure rocking go project mm wheel abec bearing compared setup using feel bit like rolling glue roll anyone else experienced currently thinking problem fitment wheel frame frame metal spacers great never problem installing wheel resort hammering literally hammer probably done wonder bearing would like hear anyone else issue issue installing wheel tip wheel installation make easier perhaps damage bearing process background general flat frame thought came skating flat year mostly riding freestyle anti rocker first frame work first line create original frame since really enjoyed skating fiziks recently oysi flat tried sola frame get slim frame wall lack wheel cupping made much difficult grind thing sola frame excellent product however build quality design went second none see work many people,"['really', 'enjoy', 'kizer', 'fluid', 'frame', 'got', 'really', 'nice', 'thick', 'frame', 'wall', 'nice', 'shallow', 'groove', 'overly', 'deep', 'groove', 'issue', 'fluid', 'fluid', 'frame', 'material', 'good', 'ever', 'frame', 'stiff', 'offer', 'great', 'power', 'transfer', 'problem', 'fluid', 'wheel', 'roll', 'like', 'struggling', 'figure', 'rocking', 'go', 'project', 'mm', 'wheel', 'abec', 'bearing', 'compared', 'setup', 'using', 'feel', 'bit', 'like', 'rolling', 'glue', 'roll', 'anyone', 'else', 'experienced', 'currently', 'thinking', 'problem', 'fitment', 'wheel', 'frame', 'frame', 'metal', 'spacers', 'great', 'never', 'problem', 'installing', 'wheel', 'resort', 'hammering', 'literally', 'hammer', 'probably', 'done', 'wonder', 'bearing', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'anyone', 'else', 'issue', 'issue', 'installing', 'wheel', 'tip', 'wheel', 'installation', 'make', 'easier', 'perhaps', 'damage', 'bearing', 'process', 'background', 'general', 'flat', 'frame', 'thought', 'came', 'skating', 'flat', 'year', 'mostly', 'riding', 'freestyle', 'anti', 'rocker', 'first', 'frame', 'work', 'first', 'line', 'create', 'original', 'frame', 'since', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'skating', 'fiziks', 'recently', 'oysi', 'flat', 'tried', 'sola', 'frame', 'get', 'slim', 'frame', 'wall', 'lack', 'wheel', 'cupping', 'made', 'much', 'difficult', 'grind', 'thing', 'sola', 'frame', 'excellent', 'product', 'however', 'build', 'quality', 'design', 'went', 'second', 'none', 'see', 'work', 'many', 'people']",156

Got size 8.5 (41) and they feel very tight lengthwise and toes are getting slightly crushed :) When I take the liner out though and put my foot in the shell, there is some space. I can slide a finger behind my heel when pushing my foot up to the front of the shell.

3319,close buying advice would appreciated,rollerblading,"Hey, first off thanks for all the posts keeping me buzzing about skating.

Secondly, I have a question about some USD skates.

  
I've been street skating regularly for around 7 months in my FRX-80's and loving it. I have gotten into aggressive skating in the last few months, rolling around bowls and getting used to transitions in my FRX-80's. I want to get some aggressive skates so that I can stall on the coping, start grinding and have a lower centre of gravity.

Ideally, I'd really like a pair of Aeon 60 Le Team Duo in green/white but I haven't been able to find any in my size for the last month or so. I've been checking out the basic model in black but can't find any of those in my size either!

However, I have found a pair of Sways (older model) in my size (10.5-11 UK) at a good price. I am a little hesitant about whether this model is any good. They seem to be an affordable and available option to start with, and I can upgrade if I keep the enthusiasm. 

Anyone know if there are any major drawbacks of this model that I might be unaware of?

TL:DR Does anyone know if Aeon 60's are going to come back in stock in UK 10-11 anytime soon? If not are these older Sways good?",hey first thanks post keeping buzzing skating secondly question usd skate street skating regularly around month frx loving gotten aggressive skating last month rolling around bowl getting used transition frx want get aggressive skate stall coping start grinding lower centre gravity ideally really like pair aeon le team duo green white able find size last month checking basic model black find size either however found pair sway older model size uk good price little hesitant whether model good seem affordable available option start upgrade keep enthusiasm anyone know major drawback model might unaware tl dr anyone know aeon going come back stock uk anytime soon older sway good,"['hey', 'first', 'thanks', 'post', 'keeping', 'buzzing', 'skating', 'secondly', 'question', 'usd', 'skate', 'street', 'skating', 'regularly', 'around', 'month', 'frx', 'loving', 'gotten', 'aggressive', 'skating', 'last', 'month', 'rolling', 'around', 'bowl', 'getting', 'used', 'transition', 'frx', 'want', 'get', 'aggressive', 'skate', 'stall', 'coping', 'start', 'grinding', 'lower', 'centre', 'gravity', 'ideally', 'really', 'like', 'pair', 'aeon', 'le', 'team', 'duo', 'green', 'white', 'able', 'find', 'size', 'last', 'month', 'checking', 'basic', 'model', 'black', 'find', 'size', 'either', 'however', 'found', 'pair', 'sway', 'older', 'model', 'size', 'uk', 'good', 'price', 'little', 'hesitant', 'whether', 'model', 'good', 'seem', 'affordable', 'available', 'option', 'start', 'upgrade', 'keep', 'enthusiasm', 'anyone', 'know', 'major', 'drawback', 'model', 'might', 'unaware', 'tl', 'dr', 'anyone', 'know', 'aeon', 'going', 'come', 'back', 'stock', 'uk', 'anytime', 'soon', 'older', 'sway', 'good']",108

3337,new bearing crap,rollerblading,"tldr: New Bones Swiss bearings should roll pretty fast right? I just got a set and I've got ragged abec 5s that seem to work better. I've skated on them for about an hour. I'm afraid I got ripped off on ebay and need to determine if I will try to get a refund. 

&amp;#x200B;

The pic is of the bearings I'm replacing.

I'm mashing together two sets of skates. I had a pair of rollerblades with senate wheels and bones swiss bearings (shown), but the straps were busted and I couldn't fit them tightly. So I got a used pair of K2s - stock - but these have completely stripped bolts, and the bolts aren't as high quality as the rollerblades. So, I moved the rollerblade frames with the senate wheels to the K2 boots and that's what I'm skating on now. 

I completely cleaned and re-lubed the bones bearings that were in the rollerblades and they still barely rolled, so I bought some new ones off of ebay. When I got them, they didn't roll any better than the ones I cleaned. I put them in my skates and headed to the park. It was pretty rough at first, but they seemed to break in a bit and roll better now.

I took them back and compared them to the ABEC 5s that were in the K2 stock wheels in their frame. They seem to work better still than the bones + senate. I noticed that the wheels are considerably smaller than the senate, so the frame might be pinching the wide wheels a bit slowing them down. The wheels were hard to install in the frame.

3406,help picking new pair skate,rollerblading,"Hi there, I’m normally a recreational figure skater on ice. And I love doing fancy foot moves and basic jumps. Since the ice rink has been shut I picked up inlines to skate around on. I’m nowhere near as graceful on land as I am on ice. But skating is my happy place so it’ll do. 

I currently have a pair of flamingo pink Powerslide swell 125mm skates. I adore these skates and just learned how to transition to skate backwards. But mostly I just use them for long distance flat skating down the foreshore of one of our lakes to burn off energy. Nothing fancy with them. I also skate around at the park on a pair of quad skates with a bunch of other quad skaters. 

Amusingly I can do more on a pair of quads than inlines. But I still prefer inlines. However ice will always be my happy place. 

I’d really like to get a pair of inlines for slalom skating I think it is and learning the fancy foot moves. And learn to skate on a rockered frame. I’ll mostly be doing it all my self from watching videos cause we don’t have a huge skating presence in my city and have no indoor skating rinks. (Just one single ice rink). So we don’t really have anywhere to take lessons. But I can always generally find a flat smooth area to practice on. 

I’d like to know the recommendations people have for a ladies skate, bearing in mind I am in Australia. My foot measures 24.7cm in length and I’ve a wide forefoot with a skinny/narrow heel.

I have to say people skating in this sub make it look easy. I fell alot. I had trouble stopping. I finally just found a parking lot to practice stopping and work on the basics...

I have a few stepdad questions for you guys...

1. How the hell can I get the ankles tighter on these things. I cranked them as far as they would go and I just couldnt get them dialed in.
2. A number of my falls were because of wet asphalt... I do live in Seattle so I put an order in for some Powerslide Torrent wheels but I am wondering how much of my falling was due o new wheels and of course my terrible skill.
3. Any tips for a total n00b on maintenance. I swear it took me loger to get into the skates than I spent actually skating...

I just had my first negative encounter with another blader on Instagram. They say this one part shared by Be-Mag was ""embarrassing to the sport,"" and videos of novice bladers ""don't belong on the platform.""

It goes without saying, this is TOXIC, gatekeeping rhetoric.

It's also important to say that this was not a novice, but that their performance was Mushroom Blading adjacent, and the gatekeeper was trying to invalidate the performance.

The Instagram comments came as such a shock to me because r/rollerblading is a STARK CONTRAST to these types of comments. I am PROUD of y'all for creating such an inclusive and supportive community here. KEEP IT UP.

That said, if you're faced with haters or trolls, not just in blading but in all of life, remember that you are not alone, and that your community is here to back you up and BURY the hate.

I normally wear a US 11 or UK 10.

The official sizing guide for the FRX 80's is 27 or 28.

Does anyone have any guidance with FR skates here, or general recommendations with Skates?

It's been a long time for me now, but really want to get back into it.

3510,iconic image logo mascot aggressive skating would look cool painted grindbox let get nostalgia going history lesson going,rollerblading,"When I was a pre-teen and teenager I was obsessed with Aggressive Inline Skating (or whatever your preferred name is). It was literally all I ever wanted to do every second of every day. 

Despite that, something that I sort of somehow missed out on was flipping through Daily Bread Magazines. Watching skate videos. Buying Senate merch, etc etc etc. It was probably due to a lack of money. My parents, god bless em, somehow managed to scrape together enough money to buy me a new pair of skates just about every year (which is roughly how quickly I was tearing through them) but that was it, my one big gift, and there was no way in hell they had cash to spare for magazines, DVDs, shirts and hoodies and whatever else. 

I am starting back up after a 10 year hiatus and am building a two-tier grind box for my driveway. I also happen to be a pretty artistic person and I want to make it look cool. 

You might say ""but shouldnt you just decorate it with cool images that mean something to you?"" and you are right. Ive got four sides to work with and I have some really cool ideas for how to paint the other three sides. I am excited to share it with you guys when its completed. I think youll get a kick out of the designs. 

But connecting with this side of the blade culture that I feel like I kind of missed out on DOES mean something to me. So I want to get a community's opinion and be filled in. Things might be different now, and they might never be the same again (something I see repeated on this subreddit a lot, and thats okay), but I still want to know about it and dedicate one side of my grind box to it.   


This will probably be a laugh to most of you, but some of the most iconic images to me (these are just things that I, the person that missed out on all this, am able to remember) are the Senate ""sinner"" character, the razors logo (always thought it looked pretty cool) and (a bit tongue-in-cheek, but) the team pup and suds logo is absolutely going on my grindbox, haha.

I haven't skated in like 15 years but for my birthday a few months back my wife got me some skates.

When getting replacement wheels, do I need to look for anything specific so this doesn't happen again?

3565,powerslide next brown city recreation commuting,rollerblading,"Hi all!

I'm looking at picking up a nice set of skates to use while living in London UK, partly for fun, but likely to be used to get around and commute as well. I skated a lot about 5 years ago, but didn't replace my last pair when I grew out of them as I was not getting much use, so I'm a little rusty, but ultimately confident about my ability.

I currently have my eyes set on the Powerslide Next Brown 125s ([https://www.locoskates.com/collections/3-wheel-skates/products/powerslide-next-brown-125-skates](https://www.locoskates.com/collections/3-wheel-skates/products/powerslide-next-brown-125-skates)) as a large wheel, three wheel setup for mostly calm, but easy to be fast(ish) skating around the city. My questions, then, are three:  


1) Anyone with experience with these in a similar setting? How do you find them?

2) Is 125 going to be too big for the city? I've heard varying things, but I can always switch them out for 110s/100s if necessary.

3) Is the hard shell boot the way to go? I wonder if for more speed/commuting and less hardcore oriented skating an integrated liner is the better option for me. (That being said, if I have to jump something or go down a staircase for example I want my ankles to be safe!)

Sadly I just moved due to my Masters program and I coul'dnt bring them with me (and I prefer to leave them back at home).   


I was just getting started into more intermediate slalom and street skating techniques so I figured Id try the highlights due to their reputation (also because they were the only carbon boot I could find my size). I actually tried the FR1 but they were stiff to the point where I couldnt really do anything. The Highlights are comftrable, I bought them the same size as my trix and seem to fit with some space for the toes. The thing is **Im scared that the higlights might never feel like the Trix in terms of mobility even after break in. If so I would prefer to return them. What then, maybe buy the trix 2 plastic boot, but I would really like other people's recommendations.** Im talking about flexibility and mobilty in terms of bending and cuff movement. I know they are supposed to be stiffer, but I am wondering if with time and maybe even heatmolding I would be able to get the same manueverabilty.

* How steep is the learning curve? (I've never skated before in my life, so safety gear will be in full use.)
* Which muscles are you engaging with rollerskating?  
* If I'm looking to work out my quads, would you consider rollerskating to be a good tool for that?

3592,people dislike new age aggressive inline,rollerblading,"Hi,

I'm not intending to bring in unnecessary negativity to this forum. I am relatively new to the aggressive inline scene and recently have noticed for the first time that, despite an overwhelming majority of people spreading positive messages, there is a current of people (some of them being bladers or fellow bladers) claiming that the newer style of aggressive inline is much less impressive/skillful. 

The main theme seems to be that, back then, the tricks being performed were bigger and braver. People would do crazy tall drop rails and fall from immense heights for the sake of a trick. Furthermore, some people from that era seem to think nowadays the tricks are way different (which they are) in that people are afraid to throw big tricks. I however really enjoy the styles of skaters like Pat Ridder, Broskow, Nemirovsky, Brattey, etc. Guys who throw tricks with immense technicality and, dare I say it, ""steez"". 

I'm guessing part of my lack of understanding why the new era of blading isn't as good is because I was first exposed to those names before the bigger old school skaters. I'm curious if anyone has any insight as I'm always interested in learning more about this amazing scene.

1 - What's a good price range or brand to get? I'm down to invest in good wheels if they last. But I don't know the difference between $90 set and a $20 set.

2 - Is 80mm to 76 a good size from what I'm doing? I like the current size I have but I don't know anything else, and online research seems to support this size.

3 - uhh Hardness? Article says 84a is good for outdoors. I had no idea what that was until 30 min ago.

My feet are almost exactly 25cm long and not particularly wide, about 9.5cm. I usually wear Vans men's US 7 and they fit perfectly. I was thinking the men's 6-7 shell would be good for me but I have seen on some sites that you should size up, just wanted to see what other people's experiences were. 

I'm looking at either the pink Bladies edition with the skinny boy liner or the white XIX with the 2nd skin. Otherwise I have found some basics with skinny boys. (The forest green Lomax's look good too though...choices choices!) 

 In regards the liner, I have a nagging foot injury on the ball of my left foot so I'd prefer more padding if possible. I'm concerned the 2nd skin won't be padded enough!

\-Would I still fit the 6-7 shell if I say bought the basics and upgraded to a fatboy liner? Or are they comparable to the skinny boy in terms of insole padding?

I grew up obsessed with golf and that is all I have done my entire adult life (13 years) dedicated to the game. I have played as a living until Covid cancelled all of my tournaments. I picked up skating this summer when I was bored and got some triskates. I loved those and skated for hours a day in the hottest summer in recorded history in my city then I discovered aggressive skating. I bought a couple pairs of aggressive skates and and now since August that’s what I try to do whenever I am not working my jobs. The problem is I am starting to push myself too hard and injuring myself and I can’t golf. Why is skating so addicting?!?! I need to stop skating before I get seriously hurt and end my career but its all I think about. 😫 Should I sell my skates to keep me away from the park?",become addicted aggressive skating good love grew obsessed golf done entire adult life year dedicated game played living covid cancelled tournament picked skating summer bored got triskates loved skated hour day hottest summer recorded history city discovered aggressive skating bought couple pair aggressive skate since august try whenever working job problem starting push hard injuring golf skating addicting need stop skating get seriously hurt end career think sell skate keep away park,"['become', 'addicted', 'aggressive', 'skating', 'good', 'love', 'grew', 'obsessed', 'golf', 'done', 'entire', 'adult', 'life', 'year', 'dedicated', 'game', 'played', 'living', 'covid', 'cancelled', 'tournament', 'picked', 'skating', 'summer', 'bored', 'got', 'triskates', 'loved', 'skated', 'hour', 'day', 'hottest', 'summer', 'recorded', 'history', 'city', 'discovered', 'aggressive', 'skating', 'bought', 'couple', 'pair', 'aggressive', 'skate', 'since', 'august', 'try', 'whenever', 'working', 'job', 'problem', 'starting', 'push', 'hard', 'injuring', 'golf', 'skating', 'addicting', 'need', 'stop', 'skating', 'get', 'seriously', 'hurt', 'end', 'career', 'think', 'sell', 'skate', 'keep', 'away', 'park']",72

I realized pretty quickly that unlike my old FRX 80s I had to strap these up super tight ankle strap to literal toe strap (had literally never adjusted the toe tightness before). Even with them as tight as I can get them, if I so much as hit a crack in a sidewalk that's too deep or land a jump toes first my big toe get bashed inside the boot whichever skate that's wheel is making contact. 

I did a lot of research before buying, so I'm pretty sure I ended up with the right size. My left foot is a bit bigger and crams in more, but with each my toes fit snuggly at the end.

Do I need put some foam in the boot or something? I've tried double socks, tightening the toe strap all the way, even just holding myself differently skating. It's just sad to be missing my old skates while riding ones that cost twice as much.

3761,hydrogen v matrix,rollerblading,"A few weeks ago I got some Atom Matrix wheels. My first replacement of the stock wheels... I have been absolutely loving them. They are FAST and hard enough that pebbles mostly just glance right off of them. I did have a little learning period where I felt like my teeth were jittering sometimes if I was on the slightest of rough surfaces, but I soon got used to the hardness and I love them. I'll probably learn slides on those unless I find a better all around wheel to use for sliding as well.

Today, I finally received the hydrogens I originally ordered toward the end of August. I've gotta say, they live up to the hype. They are a fair amount grippier than the matrix wheels, but I don't notice a loss in speed. They might not have quite the same glide, but to be fair they are marked as a point lower on the durometer. They feel sooo much smoother to me, and it seems like those pesky pebbles still glance off of them in the same way, but I don't feel the little shock wave from it. These really are nice wheels... Anyway, these are the wheels I'm gonna want to practice my wizardry on. With the extra grip, I trust my edges so much more and I feel like I have more control and balance when gliding on one foot somehow. I only took them out for about 6 miles of cruising on the trail but I love them so far and can't wait to see how they feel once they're broken in a bit more.

I still think at this point that unless I find something I like even better, I'll be using matrix for really long distance. We'll see though.

It really snaps onto ledges and coping, slides amazing and sounds real good to boot.

got these set up on the roces m12 with fat boy liners.

Only gripe would be 64 and 57 is a tad too small on wheel size and the frame slides out if you tilt too much, so maybe ill go a bit bigger when these wheels wear down, plus size would be easy cess slides!

3785,hardcore evo sizing,rollerblading,"I'm thinking of buying a Hardcore Evo boot but need help with the sizing as I will have absolutely no way to try them on before I buy and sending them back will be very expensive.  I have small feet, but they are a half size. EU36.5/UK3.5. So sizing can be very hit and miss for me.   


I have 3 skates made by Powerslide. Swells, Chaya Elite quads and Phuzion cross country skates. The Swells and Chayas are both 37, the Chayas are bigger and ever so slightly big on my foot, they aren't bad but a 36 would probably fit me too. The Swells are a really nice fit around my foot but definitely a tiny bit roomy in the toe. Nothing that interferes with performance because I mainly tend to just skate for speed/endurance in them and they feel as responsive as I need. I think a 36 would be too small. The Phuzion Cross Country are a 36 and honestly a tiny bit small but once my foot is strapped back they are fine. I also wear both Risport and Edea figure skates in a 240, which is a UK 3. I find the Risports in particular feel small until they are laced properly and then they are perfect.  


I want the EVO both for my 125mm frames and for slalom. If I only wanted them for the 125mms, I'd probably just stick with the Swells.

3799,new fr intuition miraculous story acquired,rollerblading,"Does FR sell FR1 90s with Intuition liners?  No.  Is that what I got out of their warehouse?  *Yes!*  

Before I share my happy little story, I need to give a huge shout out to Bladeville- a small outfit in Germany.  I wouldn't have landed these beauties without their help.

As many of you already know, FR1s are not easy to come by, and next to impossible to find in the US.  FR1 80 Intuitions?  Keep dreaming.  Needless to say, when I found a pair of FR1 80 Ints in my size from Bladeville (and for only around $300!) after searching for a long long time, I nearly fell over, and then immediately placed the order.  

The reason I keep popping Bladeville is because of what happened next.  In the days following my order, I learned that the 243 mm frame was way too short for my 13 US/ 47 EU boot size.  I went from ecstatic to bummed out pretty quickly.  I admit that I should have known better, but every pair of skates I had previously owned happened to have frames that were plenty long, so it never really crossed my mind.  Also, stock photos *never* showcase big boots!  Credit to guys like u/Sidivan for helping me out with that.  \[Btw, for all of you big footed skaters out there, I recommend you check out his post yesterday very effectively showing a 243 mm vs 273 mm frame comparison on a big boot.\]

I knew that FR made a 273 mm 4x90 frame, but they are quite pricey and hard to come by.  So, I went for a hail mary- I reached out to Bladeville, explained my case, and asked if there was *any* way they could switch out my 243 mm frame for the FR 273 mm.  They didn't carry that frame, but they did have a few pairs of FR1 90s.  I figured I had no shot, and their initial response wasn't great- they said they didn't even have the skates, but directly placed the order with the FR warehouse, and the order may have already been processed.  This came from Mateusz, my soon-to-be hero.  He said he'd try to reach out to FR to make this happen for me, but admitted it was a long shot.

After over a week of very pleasant e-mail exchanges with Mateusz (translating my English to German the entire time), he informed me that FR agreed to it, and only wanted an extra 20 euro for the frame swap.  I was floored!  I showered him with thanks and praise, and promised I would share my story with the Reddit community.  My next step is to try and get their shop listed on the community homepage.  

Anyways, my skates arrived yesterday and they fit like a glove.  I already love my Intuition liners, and I don't think I need to say anything about how amazing FR1s are.  It turns out FR just took a pair of FR1 90s and popped the Intuition liners from my FR1 80s in there.  Props to FR as well for agreeing to all of this (not that they need any props).

3829,skate sock first impression,rollerblading,"So up to this point I've just been using my old worn out cotton socks I use every day... recently I got bearing cleaner and lube and decided to tack on a pair of myfit socks to the order. Just took them out for about an hour this morning...

First thing I noticed was since there's more padding in the heel I kind of automatically started using my heels more, where always before if I tried shifting my weight back much at all, I felt like my skates were going to come out from under me. I've always noticed there's just a little tiny bit of wiggle room in the heel. Now I'm wondering if I should get some of those sleeve sock things that just go over the heel and ankle...

In general, I felt like on a scale of 1 to 10, switching to skate socks made my skates feel about one point more responsive, which was a bigger difference than I expected to be honest. I'd highly recommend picking some up if you haven't!

Only thing is, I always have this problem with ALL socks my whole life... they always bunch up under my toes and some socks end up giving me weird blisters under my toes where the knuckles bend. For this reason, I'm glad I'm at the upper end of the range of sizes these fit, cuz I like my socks to be really tight (the socks say 39-42, I think I'm a 42. My skates are ""42-43"" and they fit like a glove except that little wiggle room in the heel. Maybe I AM a 43). Anyway, I'm gonna definitely be picking up some other kinds to see which ones I like best, so if any of you have recommendations for specific brands (other than the vague ""I just use hockey socks""), let me know!


As a side note, would it be worth it to get a different liner?

I'm wondering if it would be more beneficial to focus on inline (since I'm also currently taking figure skating lessons again after an almost decade hiatus) or if there might be some benefit to working on both at the same time (quads on land, inline equivalent on ice). Or if people would specifically not recommend working on both styles at once, or does it just not matter? 

People who have done both, what's your preference and why? Are you happy you learned both?

3836,let talk flat setup oysi medium mainly,rollerblading,"Started a few months ago. I enjoy the anti-rocker setup but I do prefer more speed and fluidity without having to constantly pump and keep speed. Been thinking about Oysi medium chasis since I've heard they are super easy for Flat setups.  

I currently have Them 909s with FLT3 frames and 65mm wheels.

  

Few questions:    

I've heard some people have slipped or slid while turning or pushing because the frames sit low?  

What is the preferred wheel setup. 68 outside 59-60 inside? (For me the bigger the wheels the better tbh)   

I've skated these 65mms for about 3-4 weeks or so and have worn them a little so I guess I should probably get all new wheels at this point just to make sure they all fit?

3848,question outdoor skating,rollerblading,"Hi all, I've been skating for nearly two years now, and I started off playing street hockey, and then moved onto skating around the streets a bit more, and during lockdowns have obviously gotten way more into skating on trails and bike paths and around the streets. 

I have a pair of FRX80s that I got at the start of last year with hydrogen wheels and currently the bone bearings, and a pair of inline hockey skates with storm bearings and ashphalt wheels. I've noticed lately with all the outdoor skating I've been doing that I keep having issues where the wheels get loose and sometimes fall off while I'm skating. I also find that sometimes even after cleaning or replacing my bearings, the wheels can start to feel a bit...sticky? like they're not really rolling properly. The stickiness issue is more of a problem on the FRX skates and the screws keep falling out of the inline skates (which were really, really cheap second hand inline skates mind you). 

Is this an issue with not maintaining my skates properly? Do I need new axels? Or are these skates not particularly suited to skating in a range of conditions? They didn't seem to have any issues when I was primarily skating on smooth surfaces, but when I'm going over bumps and rough concrete or dirtier paths I seem to get more problems. 

I'm wondering if I should buy a new pair of skates specifically for skating on trails and rougher/dirtier/bumpier surfaces, or if there are things I should be doing with my current skates, or if this is all just a normal part of skating.

3861,unbearable foot soreness,rollerblading,"Hi guys, first post in this subreddit.  I'm sure this question comes up a lot, but I can never seem to find anything online about this specific issue.  I recently bought K2 Sodos online, which come with 4x100mm wheels that come rockered, but I have set to a flat setup.  I recently wanted to get back into inline skating after coming across Bill Stoppard's YouTube channel and promptly binging hours of videos before buying skates in my size.  My shoe size is 9.5 and found the K2 Sodos in that size and was wobbly, but able to pick up a little bit of movement.

After a few minutes, my feet were burning from skating, the picture I've linked shows the area circled in green.  I could only skate for about 10 minutes until I was sweating from the soreness, and I chalked it up to ""growing pains"" from relearning how to skate.  Three or more sessions later, the pain is still there and I've tried three different insoles, doubled socks, and even putting an insole on top of the stock insole (I know, I was desperate).  I have flat arches as well, which definitely doesn't help my situation at all.

I suppose what I'm looking for is, what is the next step?  I don't want to give it up and I'm not going out that easy, could it be that 100mm is too high to start and I should get some lower skates or frames?  I definitely notice my blades are in eversion when I'm pushing, but can't skate long enough to develop my muscles to keep my skates vertically straight.  

Sorry for the long, convoluted post.

Thanks everyone!

3865,ankle pain fed trying find skate fit,rollerblading,"... more of a rant than actually wanting advice, because I feel really bummed.

So, I always have a problem with the boots because of my navicular bone poking out. What I do is wearing myfit footies, and punching the shells out in the bone area with a headgun. That has worked pretty well with my aggressive skates.

I had some really awful and heavy K2 Uptown (4x80) but I wanted to step into the triskate world so I bought some PS Imperials. They killed my feet in the bone area, and because of the material PS uses in their newest models (Glass-fiber reinforced plastic) I couldn't heat mold them. I tried the PS Next... Same problem, also couldn't be heat molded.

I decided to try the RB 110 3WD. Their shell can be easily molded so I fixed the navicular bone problen. I skated them for some time thinking they were fine, but now that I do more distance with them they started killing my left inner ankle (I think they are pinching a tendon). 

I mean come on... I just want a pair of skates that I can skate without hurting, why it has to be so difficult?

Of course I can try different liners, try again different boots etc. but I cannot just test them 10 minutes at home and be sure they work. I need to use them for some time and do some distance with them. I have ended up buying stuff and selling them in almost new condition, half price, because they don't work for me. 

Sorry for the long post. Just wanted to let it out of me, having nothing better to do, while sitting on my couch with an ice pack on my ankle - probably out of action for the next couple of weeks.

I have pretty much only skates them on an outdoor metal skatepark and they have treated me good. Soon there will be a new skatepark in my town and it will be indoor. Because the Aeons were my first skates (which i bought in march) i had no idea about the UFS.

Now my problem is I can’t grind without waxing and in this new park waxing is not allowed. So i was thinking about buying a second setup with aluminium frame. Does this make it easier to grind or not? Because not being able to grind takes a lot of fun away for me. 

(Boot and frame i was thinking about: Roces m12 lo, kizer element v2)

3893,unbelievably angry frustrated total loss vent,rollerblading,"I've [17F] been skating for a few months now and I'm just so... frustrated. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm saddened by myself. I'm too this, I'm too that. Maybe the  emotion I'm feeling is exasperated by that time of month, but I don't really care. 


I can't even do a t stop. I try and try and try and it feels hopeless. I recently rockered my skates for slalom but I derive no fun from slalom. Not that I can do it, anyway. I keep slipping on my skates both with the rocker and doing a t stop. I feel clumsy. It sucks. I watch people be good with slalom and feel sad. 


I have been suggested to do speed skating by a speed skater that couldn't be bothered to talk to me after the first time we met. I knew I was going to feel alienated by him. I like going fast but I don't have enough stamina for it. 


I'd do urban skating but my parents know I can't break without a back break. So that's kind of annoying. Especially since I want to get tri skates and there's a certain size where you can't get one. I think it's 110 mm, which I want. And I always trip over the break doing cross overs. 


Finally, aggressive rollerblading. I'm too pussy to do it. I've been to the skate park once, by myself, only to get mocked by some scooter kids for being amateur and wearing protective pads. Within hindsight, I should've ""accidentally"" fallen over right in their path and tripped them up. Anyway, there's so few aggressive skaters that I'm kind of stuck and can't really learn anything. And I still can't break. I'm too weak. 


All of this shares one thing: I feel alienated. I'm 17 and most of the people I skate with are way older than me. I'm weary of adults because I had one skater friend I made hit on me as a 25 year old. I'm too scared to connect with any adults because of that. All the female aggressive skaters are on quads so I feel alienated by being on inlines. The teenagers are mostly speed skaters and I feel alienated by not being a speed skater. I feel alienated for being a beginner in everything and needing guidance. The only friend I have to skate with is 14M. On top of all of this, I'm autistic and have anxiety so I struggle with people skills and making friends.

On Ice I can do footwork stuff (crossovers, 3-turns, etc...) one foot spin (although I travel a lot...), waltz, salchow, toe loop, loop, flip and lutz. 

I've been using my moms old pair of pic skates to practice off ice, the boots don't fit nearly as nice as my ice skates, but with some thick socks they've been good enough. 

The other day though I noticed that the boot is coming unglued from the bottom part that's attached to the frame with the wheels. Since the boot doesn't really fit well anyway I'm thinking of maybe just getting a new boot and attaching the frame/wheels I already have, or I could just get a whole new pair, not really sure what the move is. (It's 4 wheels btw) 

While it's nice to practice things I'm doing on ice, I really just want a pair to have fun on. I like putting in headphones and just messing around, so it's not crucial they feel exactly like ice skates (which is impossible anyway because its wheels not a blade). I'd like to be able to attempt some jumps or other fancy things.

At a first in-flat fitting session and thanks to the community i found out that the arch pain i had during just sitting around came from the insoles. Removing them removed the problem (at first).  


However today after my first one hour session (during which i learned that i have to re-learn quite a lot more than i thought initially), the arch pain in the FR1 without any insoles was back after half an hour or so and towards the full hour it was really very much dragging away all my focus from riding.  


As suggested by a fellow redditor yesterday, i ordered some superfeet carbon pro's. However now that even without any insoles i had some pain, i wonder if the superfeet will even make things any better at all?  


I'm by no means any shoe or medical expert so i don't know if it will be better with the insoles or worse. My arch is on the lower side of ""normal"" i would say.  


If it really boils down to exchange the blades for a different model, is there even something similar wide on the toes with more room for the arch for a 185cm 90kilo rider?

3941,kind skate buy returning beginner,rollerblading,"Hello,

This is my first post in this community so hi all! 👋 

I'll just jump right in. From about 9 to 13ish years of age, I skated with my inlines every single day for hours. Its how I grew up and I was teaching myself lots of tricks and getting pretty good. But then life happened, and I had to unfortunately stop. I forgot about skating and never thought about it again until recently and I can't stop thinking about how much I loved it. So I need help with finding a pair that will suit me!

I have no idea the terms or anything like that in regards to the skates. But im looking to skate outdoors, on mostly sidewalks and roads and such. Im not too interested in doing tricks yet, I need to relearn the basics first but eventually I'd like to work my way there. 

I've also gained a lot of weight and I'm just worried I won't be able to skate very well until I loose it. (I'm currently 255 lbs) my bf bought me a pair of Rollerblade inline skates but it seems the boot doesn't have a lot of support because my foot shifts over even though they are tied as tight as they can go. I dont know if it was something I was doing wrong or not. 

So I thought I'd ask here about what brand you thought would be best for me? 

Sorry for the long post, I'm really excited about this and just want to get as much information as I can. 😊

Today i finally recieved my ordered FX1 80s in white. Since the weather was bad and i was bound to my flat, i decided to at least wear them inside for a while to check on how they fit, if they can stay or if i have to return them for a different size.  


Now in general im feeling super comfy, they are snug but not painful. Toes touch the front when they are laced and buckled up and im standing but they are not forcefully pushed against the front. Wideness of the front part of my foot is also a perfect fit.  


However there is one point where they do generate a bit of pressure. I have heard that with lacing i can somewhat at least a bit influence on where they feel tight and where not.  


(i will attatch images for clarification) on the inside of my feet, below the inner ankle, where this arc is, the boot puts up quite the pressure when laced rather tightly with default crisscross lacing. Its on the lower part of okay-ish if im just in my flat with the boots on. Maybe it takes some ""getting used to it"" over time, maybe i can improve comfort with proper lacing technique, maybe its just that way and i have to deal with it, i dont know yet.  


So if what i have heard is right, how should i try to lace them to give that area below the ankle just a teeny bit more room?  


Best regards  
Lorenz

catchy title of the post, I know - but it is actually what I'm asking! :D Do any of you have tips on how to learn running/sprinting on skates?

I've progressed a fair bit in the last few months but there's one thing in my hometown that still really challenges mean, and that is really rough surfaces with no chance to pick up speed beforehand. (e.g. Edinburgh has a lot of absolutely DESTROYED intersections, in combination with these stopper-surfaces and very narrow side paths + really crammed roads + hills).

There's sometimes no chance to pick up speed via rolling so I figured I need to learn how to start off comfortably via sprint/run, but I am a bit sheepish about it. Any tips on how to get into it?

  
I also figured this will help a lot when I am forced to move off the path on sandy/grassy bit, cause I've already had that and while I tried rolling/running into it, it didn't work out super well and I ended up on my bum :D

3984,advice request skate purchase,rollerblading,"&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago I bought some blades without any research at all and they were wrong for me. I wrote about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/rollerblading/comments/irnlqx/advice\_please\_what\_wheels\_frames\_should\_i\_get/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rollerblading/comments/irnlqx/advice_please_what_wheels_frames_should_i_get/)

&amp;#x200B;

I think I've decided the most sensible thing to do is sell my Roces M12's and get a brand new pair of skates (as the M12's are the wrong wheels AND I think the shell is too narrow for my wide feet.)

&amp;#x200B;

**What kind of skating I want to do:**

&amp;#x200B;

Skating around the pavements here (UK, so rubbish quality pavements) and sometimes going to a park but I am a long way away from grinding. I used to ice skate and I enjoy that kind of thing: turns, spins, jumps... messing about basically. I think that qualifies as ""freestyle""?

&amp;#x200B;

I like the idea of a hard boot (I have dodgy ankles and like the feeling of being protected) but also (of course) like the idea of a light boot so I don't get tired and don't have to work too hard!

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, the M12's were \*very\* uncomfortable and I \*think\* I have wide feet...

&amp;#x200B;

**My research:**

&amp;#x200B;

Reading around it seems people recommend the FR1 ([https://www.locoskates.com/collections/freestyle-skates/products/fr-skates-fr1-80-light-blue](https://www.locoskates.com/collections/freestyle-skates/products/fr-skates-fr1-80-light-blue)) for wide feet and they seem great - but I don't know \*anything\*. It's sounding like I want 4\*80's anyway? Although the FR1's were more than I was expecting, what's the difference between the FR1's and the FR3's ([https://www.locoskates.com/collections/freestyle-skates/products/fr-skates-fr3-80](https://www.locoskates.com/collections/freestyle-skates/products/fr-skates-fr3-80))?

&amp;#x200B;

I like the low profile with the Powerslide Next 80's ([https://www.locoskates.com/collections/freestyle-skates/products/powerslide-next-80-core-black-2020-skates](https://www.locoskates.com/collections/freestyle-skates/products/powerslide-next-80-core-black-2020-skates)) but are they good for wide feet too?

Early on in quarantine, I got it in my head that getting back into inline skating was a must. I picked up a fairly inexpensive pair of skates from amazon ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FN1YM2Z/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FN1YM2Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1))  figuring if I got the hang of things I would invest in a better pair. This was in March. Lol. 

Admittedly, I thought I would just throw these on and muscle memory would take over but that wasn't the case. For those of you that restarted after 10+ years or are currently getting back into things, how long did it take for you to get the hang of it &amp;&amp; what did you do when you felt discouraged?

Should I ditch the inexpensive skates? Pick up brakes? Practice for x amount of time daily/weekly? I feel like I've read so many posts and found a lot of helpful info but I think I also just need to put things in my own voice so I apologize for the redundancy of this thread.

4007,tighten support fr cuff,rollerblading,"Hi -- I posted earlier this week about my surprise with the amount of flex in FR boots (compared to my Twister Edges) and have been trying to resolve that feeling. 

Today on a skate I realized I've got quite a lot of room in the cuff area between the boot an liner. I've tightened my straps down as much as possible but still have a good centimeter of room between my liner and the actual boot itself. Which means I'm only supported in that area by the liner for the most part. 

I believe I've got my cuff positioned in the down/forward option --- looking straight at the cuff bolt the markings look like this (O|).

Should I cut the cuff strap down so I can push more of it into the buckle so the cuff tightens as much as possible? Is there a better cuff position for my issue? Any other tips?

Much appreciated!

4015,something bit different,rollerblading,"We've been working the past few months on a new side project and in the last weeks we've taken the wraps off the [website](https://www.veelo.tech/?SID=RE) and been preparing for our impending kickstarter launch.  However awareness and user research are still a big deal and we're always on the lookout for info.  So we've come to the experts, in the hopes that there's some good insights I haven't yet seen.

So what is it?  Well [here's a short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46ZuYOPJSPM).

https://preview.redd.it/0nnw4u1uc3s51.png?width=1313&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=536b70bbb8c6ad692d158d504f2929794c002d24

We're calling it [Veelo](https://www.veelo.tech/?SID=re) and it's basically an eMobility add-on device for inline, that you can also use with quad skates, skateboards, longboards, and hopefully skis/snowboards once we get some snow to test with.  Veelo takes a powerful BLDC hub motor and long-range Li-Ion batteries, and combines them in an incredibly easy-to-use way that pairs naturally with inline.

We've been prototype-testing Veelo in a lot of scenarios: long rides, hills, parks, streets, skateparks, and with riders from children to semi-pro, beginner to expert.  So far everyone has picked it up and been able to ride within minutes of first seeing it and everyone has had a great time however they choose to use it.  But that's not enough feedback and hopefully we can get some more good info here.

Things to note:

* This is definitely a prototype.  I'm now about 70% of the way to the alpha build and as soon as we finish fundraising and first snow tests we'll decide on the components for the Beta and production version.
* It's designed to be a puller and it doesn't have a traction problem even though you don't sit on it.  You can of course use it as a pusher (and some have), but it doesn't need to be behind you to get traction on the wheel.  It'll accelerate you up to max speed easily, on hills, and there's been some really good feedback on how to make it better in the alphas.
* We're going to be selling these, but we aren't selling them now.  There's an upcoming Kickstarter for this and we're happy to discuss that, but right now it's about getting info.
* No, it's not much exercise.  It's actually the opposite of that.  But what it does do is let you go farther, faster, and much easier.  It's like an eBike for skates and was actually designed as a way for my kid to keep up on long skates but I overdid it and now I can't let her use it at full power.
* It comes with regenerative braking so it actually makes riding on hills and stopping a **lot** safer for beginner and intermediate skaters.

We'd love to get any comments, for instance:

* Is this something you'd consider using? 
* Would you buy something like this? Would you rent it for an afternoon?
* How far would you say is ""enough"" range?
* Do you think the ability to use your own skates and boards (if you do both) is an advantage?
* What's a target price you would consider for something like this, keeping in mind most eBikes start at over $1,000?

Thanks in advance to everyone for feedback and we'll be here to answer any questions as best we can (although today is still a big day in terms of testing and prep and our ""social media team"" is the same as the ""design and build it"" team).

Old guy here on the learning curve.

My next wanna do, but can't, is grinding on coping.
Started from frontside, manage to fairly consistently stall and 180 back to the ramp, but just can't slide.

Trying to approach my stalling spot from aside, but it results either ugly stall or just slide out to the concrete.
Any tips? The technique itself for stall and slide is same and just the speed direction is different, wider feet position maybe, anything else? 

Also small question on rails, i started to commit on those,  but likely not having enough speed.

As my grind looks like, hope on rail  and immediately out of it, without any slide.

Is it normal to wax rails? Or just commit on high speed? 

Also the body and the hips, it seems that what is working on the ledge ain't working on the rail. Need to be exactly on top of it? As i think my hips are more on the side you know.

[https://youtu.be/enX9iWe9M2s](https://youtu.be/enX9iWe9M2s)

Bishop has basically replaced our previous DIY, called The Wig, which we'd gotten a nice five-year run out of. Us Detroit bladers played a pretty big part in The Wig: we built about a quarter of the obstacles. Bishop is on track to get official city permission soon, and I think next summer we will be very busy there.

My car was out of commission for most of the summer so I couldn't really get building at Bishop, but about a month ago we were able to finally start building again, and have completed two obstacles- a wacky channel-gap quarter and ledge- and have helped with a third, a little 2ft tall micro-quarter.

Here's Jeremy Troia's first session, including the micro-quarter:

I just got my wheels replaced on my aeon 60s and I’ve found that the new wheels are much less efficient than the old ones, which were the ones the skates came with, to the point where it detracts from my enjoyment of the experience.

I have had an injury to the ball of my foot in the past and feel like a liner with decent padding is important to me, I was wondering what the liner of the basic and XIX is like compared to the Jug liner in my current skates? Would the Skinnyboy be similar or much thinner than my Jugs? (lol)

I had an idea that I could change the liner out to a thicker one but I was concerned it would affect the sizing. I tried the Basics in size 7.5-8 and felt they were on the loose side. The dude at the skate shop said I could go the size down. I was wondering if I got fat boy liners would they make the smaller size too big?

My feet are pretty much 25cm, I wear size 7 vans and skate size 7 SL's at the moment which fit well. I'd rather just skate the skinnyboys if there isn't much difference. Liners are expensive!

First things first I'm using fr skates fr1 with default 80mm frames. It's a single screw that goes into the frame and not a pair to assemble. Now for the problem:

I've changed bearings last week for rust proof ones (winter is coming) and I realised the shitty situation I'm in, if I tighten the bolt as explained on my old post some wheels are slowed by the pressure. But if I unscrew a little bit, the spacer starts to make noise due to space between the spacer and the bearings. One could argue that thread lock nullify the problem since the spacer can move but the bolt will be locked... but moving parts will probably reduce durability. Do you have any idea on how to fix? Is the frame damaged? The axles? Maybe the wheels?

I normally wear a foot size 7.5 UK (40-41EU), but after measuring my mondopoint (25.5cm) I went for a size 6 boot as that seemed to tally with the FRX size guide chart ([http://frskates.com/about-us/size-range](http://frskates.com/about-us/size-range)) as well as the size guide on the skatepro website. However upon getting the boots in the post today I can barely get my foot into them, and my toes are crushed up at the end/feet slightly arched to get in so I feel like it must be too small. 

I'm now wondering whether I should go up one or two sizes from here, as as far as I can see on online shops my options are either a 7 (EU40) or an 8 (EU41). Does anyone have any experience with this boot who might have an idea on which might be a better fit? Any advice would be much appreciated!

Thanks :)",hi complete newbie research decided frx first ever rollerblade normally wear foot size uk eu measuring mondopoint cm went size boot seemed tally frx size guide chart http frskates com u size range http frskates com u size range well size guide skatepro website however upon getting boot post today barely get foot toe crushed end foot slightly arched get feel like must small wondering whether go one two size far see online shop option either eu eu anyone experience boot might idea might better fit advice would much appreciated thanks,"['hi', 'complete', 'newbie', 'research', 'decided', 'frx', 'first', 'ever', 'rollerblade', 'normally', 'wear', 'foot', 'size', 'uk', 'eu', 'measuring', 'mondopoint', 'cm', 'went', 'size', 'boot', 'seemed', 'tally', 'frx', 'size', 'guide', 'chart', 'http', 'frskates', 'com', 'u', 'size', 'range', 'http', 'frskates', 'com', 'u', 'size', 'range', 'well', 'size', 'guide', 'skatepro', 'website', 'however', 'upon', 'getting', 'boot', 'post', 'today', 'barely', 'get', 'foot', 'toe', 'crushed', 'end', 'foot', 'slightly', 'arched', 'get', 'feel', 'like', 'must', 'small', 'wondering', 'whether', 'go', 'one', 'two', 'size', 'far', 'see', 'online', 'shop', 'option', 'either', 'eu', 'eu', 'anyone', 'experience', 'boot', 'might', 'idea', 'might', 'better', 'fit', 'advice', 'would', 'much', 'appreciated', 'thanks']",91

4112,regarding slide power stop,rollerblading,I have very cheap fitness skates that I bought a few months ago. I noticed that when I try and slide on them or powerslide I often don't commit to it. I think Maybe because the frame is plastic it feels inconsistent when I try to slide because of the flex. I tried doing a magic slide and had the front skate just started rolling while I was trying to slide on it. I don't want to blame the gear since I'm still pretty new to skating but it feels like I can't expect them to behave consistently. I would like to hear some opinions and if anyone has had similar issues with plastic frames. Sorry for the long post.

I decided to do something today I had never done before, and that is to skate around the neighborhood. It went well for the most part. However, I did notice that it was very difficult to keep up the pace; and in some cases, it was hard to even skate at all, due to the texture on the otherwise seemingly perfect roads.

Now, obviously the answer to my question is yes, the specialized spacer required to make the wheels work will slow them down. That said, could the restraint in rotation created by the spacer paired with the rough terrain be affecting my glide this much? I see videos of others skating on much rougher-looking roads, and they don’t seem to be struggling.

4197,rotated wheel rockered setup acting strange,rollerblading,"Hey everyone! I just got into rollerblading recently, and I snagged myself a pair of FR FRX 80’s with prerockered frames.

I’ve been using them HEAVILY for about a month now (really into slalom), and I’m right foot dominant. Therefore, my back right wheel was wearing down rather quickly. I heard that rotating your wheels was a good way of preserving their longevity. 

I did a full rotation and as a result transferred my Back Right Wheel to the position of Second from Front Left Wheel.

Now, with my full rocker setup, that wheel on my left foot is completely null and void. There’s always two wheels making contact, but that second from front (previously back wheel) is never making contact with the ground.

ANYWAY!

Is this something I should be concerned about? Is there a fix? Or will it resolve itself over time as use the other 3 wheels?

I still don't want to give up on the Twisters, I believe they might be great if they were not killing me in several places... I would like to try heat mold the spot but the material is quite thick there. Normally I see people heat molding places like ankles of cuff where the shell is thinner.

With the amount of flex I was experiencing, I put on my 4x80 rollerblade frame on the FR1s for additional stability, but I'm still not feeling great about the FR1s. I wish I had known how much flex is in the plastic, so for anyone wondering, maybe you'll learn through this post.

These are the only models that are available in my place:  
Powerslide Next Core 100

Powerslide Zoom Pro 100  
Powerslide Zoom Pro 80  
**Powerslide Phuzion Radon 80**  
**Powerslide Phuzion Enzo 90**  
**Powerslide Radon Teal 90**

The last 3 is what I am looking at since the prices are for entry-level and I don't want to spend a lot on my first skate.

My foot dimension is **265mm x 109mm**

This is Powerslide Phuzion's chart: [http://prntscr.com/ussc0p](http://prntscr.com/ussc0p)

My length fits with the 40-41 size but my width is too big, that it doesn't belong to any size...I am worried that the skate is too tight for me.  


What to do? Help, please 😭

4274,making custom inner slider,rollerblading,"So, my Seba's have a protective toe cap and outer slider, but [the inner edge](https://i.imgur.com/30sTpJB.jpg) of the boot is some kind of layered vinyl, and I'm sure it'll tear apart after a few deep-lunge slides if I don't do something to prevent it. I'm so used to the resilience of plastic boots, I'd hate for these to get all torn up.

Amazon has some cheap [sheets of semi-rigid grip tape](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4MZ5FM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fab_z7uEFbDNHMGH3), so I figured I'd give it a shot. Turned out great!

I was decent but not a lot of skate parks back then so mostly just cruising and going down hills.. Anyway I picked it up again, and have been going for 10 to 15 mile rides along a bike trail in Seattle.. I was using prototypical rollerblade, 80 mm x 4 wheels with not a lot of problems ( 1 crash due to sticks which I came out fine) .. Cruising speed is about 10 to 12 mph.. 

So having much more cash at age 52, I invested in some 110mm x 3 wheels, high stiff boot with a brake.. I confess I am afraid to take them out of the box.. I mean I am about 25 lbs heavier and it hurts to hit the pavement at this age.. How much faster will these guys go with a moderate effort? Are 3 wheels, or being 20 mm higher a lot harder to control?

4424,new blade instant sore ankle wrong,rollerblading,"Bladed a good amount as a teenager. Turning 30 soon and having an early midlife crisis I guess.

Anyway, the boot is 'Powerslide Swell Lite 100 Trinity Inline Skates'. 

Heat molded the inner linings but ankles are sore just skating in the house for 10 seconds. I don't mean uncomfortable, I mean actually painful. Boot fits great otherwise - correct width on the foot, toes are spot on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed there is a lot of movement (speaking when the boot is unlatched) of the inner lining so I was able to move the tongue towards the inner ankle (which hurts the most) before buckling. This helped significantly and brought it down to just discomfort.

&amp;#x200B;

I've experimented with loose, tight, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a case of breaking them in? Can the actual boot itself also be molded? The package doesn't seem to suggest so.

4428,thought roces lo boot sizing arrived,rollerblading,"Hi,

I want to share some thoughts about roces m12 lo skates, the 2020 model (black Buio).
I do hope this post helps someone to get the right skates.
Ordered online after some heavy research and bunch of hesitations. 

Lets start that my feet are average. About 271mm length and just slightly wider than 100mm.
I ordered siz3 UK8/US9/EU42. 

I was really concerned about the sizing of the shell, and all this repetitive miss information on various threads. 
First of all, without the liners, shell is pretty big, i think it is about 280mm length, and i don't touch it also width wise. So i really don't get all the narrow statements. To me it seems average. 

Yes the liners are tight, but i really hope they will break in, right? if plastic is ok, liners should stretch a bit i hope, it is not 'comfortable' out of the box, but I've spent too much time and money buying too big skates. 
Recently we went to strict lockdown rules, so can't take them out yet. Will try to break in them at home. 

on first impression the materials quality is great, really liked it, everything. it doesnt feel cheap as in some other skates i tried.

4447,back blading year many option different style help choosing new pair blade would massively appreciated,rollerblading,"Hello!  


To make this as short and un-bloated as possible. Im returning to blading and am a bit overwhelmed about the massive variety of different blade styles compared to many years ago. Sadly there are no local stores open (the few we have are closed thanks to corona) so online shopping is my only hope so far. So the rough facts from my end:  


Rider facts:  
32 years old, last time bladed around 15 years ago, currently due to corona at 90 kilos (am a judo practicioner and in peak shape would normally be around 95 kilos - as a side effect of that sport, i do know how to fall). Usual shoe size 46 depending on how the shoe is cut sometimes 45, sometimes 47 but in general in the 46 ballpark. Foot is wider than average at front, narrow shoes are a no-no! I already own a well fitting helmet from my longboard. The helmet is around 2 years old, so that should still be good. Knee and Elbowprotection i could reuse from my motocross gear if needed, gloves from my biking gear.  


Riding preference:  
To zoom around the city mostly, sometimes to visit parks. To ride with and teach my daughter (she's 7 and wants to start learning). I definately prefer agility and control over speed being a city and all (but speed is still nice though specially on bike lanes). Little stones and cracks should not be a reason to trip, so if reasonable not the smallest wheel diameters - if that even makes any difference, i honestly dont know. Im a little rusty, so for starts the blades should have a break installed until i learn how to break without them. Im not into tricks and agressive style riding, the maximum i will try is jumping over/onto/off from some obstacles (thats to keep in mind with my naked body weight regarding sturdiness).  


Budget:  
something around 200€ would be nice. 300€ is the limit, up to 350€ if the blades are REALLY worth their money and you convince me of that...  


First ideas from what i could figure out on google:  
Freeskates (or fitness?) wheel diameter around 90mm (or rather 84 or 100?)  
Powerslides are readily available it seems but i have picked up somewhere that they are rather narrow built. How about ""Rollerblades""? Other brands i should look into?

4459,c blade beginner move,rollerblading,"hey y’all, i finally got my protective gear a few weeks back but we’ve been getting hit by rain until this week where we got a “cold” front wooo, i haven’t actually skated for more than 20min since like maybe a year ago? i was at college in a very hilly city so as a beginner it really stopped me from practicing

now that i have my gear I’m trying to be more fearless and throw myself into my skating because what do i have to be scared of? if I’m wearing my gear i shouldn’t get hurt or at least badly, i practiced falling just to see what it would feel like and my gear feels great

I’ve always known how to go forward, i can take really wide turns like rolling forward then i’ll maybe shift one foot and lean to the left and slowly turn left i think that’s called carving? but what i really wanted to learn how to do was the C thing i wish i knew what it was actually called, not sure if it’s a transition or what but, when you’re rolling forward you’re supposed to stick one leg in back of you almost like you’re going to do a T stop but it’s supposed to be a more open T so your feet make a “C”, or if you dance then basically first position, and it’s supposed to make you turn around? i was trying to do this but it was basically just making me stop which is funny because a lot of the times when i’d try to t stop i wouldn’t even stop, idk if I’m not bending deep enough or shifting my weight enough to the front foot that I’m not dragging the other? 

i know i have a lot to work on but how do i do the c so i can practice turning around, i’ll also take any other tips on how to t stop properly and other ways to get turned around or turn in general, it’s definitely harder on blades than it seems on roller skates but i bought my blades a long time ago so this is what i have to work with, i really want to advance in skill level because there’s no point in staying static and only knowing how to go forward, i want to be able to transition and carve and do sharp turns and hopefully park skate soon ! 

ps i have watched youtube videos if that would be the first thing you’d tell me to do, even after watching a bunch i go outside and try what i learned but it wouldn’t work well (ex the c and t stopping) I’m sure it’s because I’m not doing them right because obviously they’re not working lmao but I’m not sure how i’m doing them wrong that they won’t work, I’m hoping if maybe i hear it a different way it would help me get these down",hey finally got protective gear week back getting hit rain week got cold front wooo actually skated min since like maybe year ago college hilly city beginner really stopped practicing gear trying fearless throw skating scared wearing gear get hurt least badly practiced falling see would feel like gear feel great always known go forward take really wide turn like rolling forward maybe shift one foot lean left slowly turn left think called carving really wanted learn c thing wish knew actually called sure transition rolling forward supposed stick one leg back almost like going stop supposed open foot make c dance basically first position supposed make turn around trying basically making stop funny lot time try stop even stop idk bending deep enough shifting weight enough front foot dragging know lot work c practice turning around also take tip stop properly way get turned around turn general definitely harder blade seems roller skate bought blade long time ago work really want advance skill level point staying static knowing go forward want able transition carve sharp turn hopefully park skate soon p watched youtube video would first thing tell even watching bunch go outside try learned work well ex c stopping sure right obviously working lmao sure wrong work hoping maybe hear different way would help get,"['hey', 'finally', 'got', 'protective', 'gear', 'week', 'back', 'getting', 'hit', 'rain', 'week', 'got', 'cold', 'front', 'wooo', 'actually', 'skated', 'min', 'since', 'like', 'maybe', 'year', 'ago', 'college', 'hilly', 'city', 'beginner', 'really', 'stopped', 'practicing', 'gear', 'trying', 'fearless', 'throw', 'skating', 'scared', 'wearing', 'gear', 'get', 'hurt', 'least', 'badly', 'practiced', 'falling', 'see', 'would', 'feel', 'like', 'gear', 'feel', 'great', 'always', 'known', 'go', 'forward', 'take', 'really', 'wide', 'turn', 'like', 'rolling', 'forward', 'maybe', 'shift', 'one', 'foot', 'lean', 'left', 'slowly', 'turn', 'left', 'think', 'called', 'carving', 'really', 'wanted', 'learn', 'c', 'thing', 'wish', 'knew', 'actually', 'called', 'sure', 'transition', 'rolling', 'forward', 'supposed', 'stick', 'one', 'leg', 'back', 'almost', 'like', 'going', 'stop', 'supposed', 'open', 'foot', 'make', 'c', 'dance', 'basically', 'first', 'position', 'supposed', 'make', 'turn', 'around', 'trying', 'basically', 'making', 'stop', 'funny', 'lot', 'time', 'try', 'stop', 'even', 'stop', 'idk', 'bending', 'deep', 'enough', 'shifting', 'weight', 'enough', 'front', 'foot', 'dragging', 'know', 'lot', 'work', 'c', 'practice', 'turning', 'around', 'also', 'take', 'tip', 'stop', 'properly', 'way', 'get', 'turned', 'around', 'turn', 'general', 'definitely', 'harder', 'blade', 'seems', 'roller', 'skate', 'bought', 'blade', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'work', 'really', 'want', 'advance', 'skill', 'level', 'point', 'staying', 'static', 'knowing', 'go', 'forward', 'want', 'able', 'transition', 'carve', 'sharp', 'turn', 'hopefully', 'park', 'skate', 'soon', 'p', 'watched', 'youtube', 'video', 'would', 'first', 'thing', 'tell', 'even', 'watching', 'bunch', 'go', 'outside', 'try', 'learned', 'work', 'well', 'ex', 'c', 'stopping', 'sure', 'right', 'obviously', 'working', 'lmao', 'sure', 'wrong', 'work', 'hoping', 'maybe', 'hear', 'different', 'way', 'would', 'help', 'get']",217

Also, is there an inline skating forum or buy/sell/trade on reddit?  I searched but couldn't find anything. 

&amp;nbsp;

I wear a US10 shoe (28cm) and my foot is somewhat wide (10.5cm)

&amp;nbsp;

These are the skates I'm looking at (all skates are 4x80):

* FR2 (Can hardly find these even listed anywhere)
* FR3
* Flying Eagle F6S (Haven't seen as much info on these, nice price but not a fan of the aesthetics of the flying eagle frames)
* Rollerblade RB80 Pro (think these are discontinued in the US?)
* Rollerblade Twister Edge (I heard these run narrow? non-rockerable frames)
* Powerslide Next  (not sure about these, tbh)

&amp;nbsp;

I like the idea of rockerable frames because I would also like to get a 3x110 frame and wheel setup to swap out in the future, effectively giving me 3 configurations out of the same boot (4 configs if the 3x110 frames are rockerable).  For that reason, I'm thinking FR is the move.
